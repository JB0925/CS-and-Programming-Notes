Created Monday 09 August 2021

Step 1). Create a shape, then click **fill**.

Step 2). At the top click and scroll to where it says **image**.

It will bring up a checkered rectangle, and in the middle it will say "**choose image**" Click that.

Find the image you wish to use, and let it fill the initial shape.


**Create a Mask:**
	- next, create a new shape and place it inside of the shape that has the image fill.
	
	- At the top, click **use as mask**
	
	  - Finally, on the **shape with the background image**, hold **control** and click over on the left on the shape name. Click **move to front** and your other shape will now be a mask for the shape with the image background.


Once set, **group both** by hitting **Control + g**

Once they are grouped, you can then move your **mask shape **anywhere you want.
