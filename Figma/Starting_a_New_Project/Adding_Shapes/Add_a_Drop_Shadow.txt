====== Add a Drop Shadow ======
Created Monday 09 August 2021

Once you have created your shape, **you must give the shape's "fill" at least 1% opacity, or no shadow will show.**

From there, you can click **effect** and choose **drop shadow**. Once you've done that, you can play with the **x, y, blur**, and **opacity percentage** to get the desired shadow.
