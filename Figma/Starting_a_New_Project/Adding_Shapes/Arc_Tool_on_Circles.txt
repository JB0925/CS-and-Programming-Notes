====== Arc Tool on Circles ======
Created Monday 09 August 2021

Create a Circle using the shape tool.

Then, hover over it. A single dot will appear. Click the dot to change the **sweep of the circle**.

Inside of that, another dot will appear, which will take out the middle of the circle to a degree which you set.
