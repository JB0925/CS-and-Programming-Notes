====== How to Compile a C Program ======
Created Thursday 21 January 2021

first command is **gcc** (GNU C Compiler)

running **gcc filename.c** will create a binary file in the same directory


**How to execute the Binary that is produced?:**
	- '**./binary_name.out** will execute the binary file
	

**How to change the name of the output/binary that is produced?:**
	- **gcc filename.c -o new_name_here**
	- execute the new file with '**./new_name_here**
	

**Some Options and What they Mean:**
	- **gcc** : name of the compiler
	- **-std=c11** : the standard to be used to compile is the C version from 2011.
	- **-Wall** : means to not display all of the warning messages
	- **-fmax-errors=10 **: means to only display up to 10 error messages at a time
	- **-Wextra **: gives more advanced warnings other than for things like syntax errors, etc.
	- **program_name.c -o new_name** : name of the program to be executed, then the **-o** is for renaming the binary file
