====== File System ======
Created Wednesday 13 January 2021

**Common Directory Names:**
	"**/bin**" - this is the directory that contains all of the basic commands needed to start and use a minimal system.
	
	"**/sbin**" - this directory contains executable commands (also known as **binaries**) for the super user / root user
			- root user is the administrator, and has more powers than a regular user
	
	"**/home**" - this directory contains all of the user directories (i.e. "/home/jesse)
	
	"**/root**" - the home directory of the root user / super user / administrator
	
	"**/etc**" - this directory contains configuration files; stands for Editable Text Configuration
	
	"**/lib**" - this directory stores software libraries required for the executables in "**/bin** and "**/sbin**.
	
	"**/tmp**" - a directory for temporary files ....not a good place to save for long term storage...it is emptied every time you restart your computer
	
	"**/var**" - contains various files used by the OS including databases, email boxes, and history. Much of what has happened on the system can be found in "**/var/logs**.
	
	"**/usr**" - acronym for **Unix System Resources**, it contains subfolders that are used to extend system operations
			- for example, **"/usr/bin** has executables (**binaries**) that are not already present in "**/bin**, and therefore are not essential to a minimal system
			- same as above for "**/user/lib**
			
	"**/dev**" - files that directly or indirectly correspond to a physical device
			**Examples:**
				- "/dev/printer
				- "/dev/memory
				- "/dev/networkcard
