====== Interpreters vs. Compilers ======
Created Thursday 21 January 2021

Think of **Interpreters **and **Compilers** as translators. 


**Interpreters:**
	- take a set of instructions
	- interprets them **one at a time**, and passes them on to the hardware in the interpreted state
	- runs more slowly than a compiler


**Compiler:**
	- takes a set of instructions
	- interprets them **all at once**, then passes them back to you
	- you then give the interpreted instructions to the machine, and the machine **executes them all at once**
	- after compiling (which takes some time), **everything moves very fast**
	- the problem here is that, if you make a mistake, it is too late to fix it
