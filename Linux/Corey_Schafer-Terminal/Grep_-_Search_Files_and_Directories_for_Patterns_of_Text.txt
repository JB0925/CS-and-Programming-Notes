====== Grep - Search Files and Directories for Patterns of Text ======
Created Thursday 03 December 2020

**Grep = Global Regular Expression Print**

**Search a File for a particular text pattern:**
	**grep "text here" file.txt**
		results will be displayed if they are found, else it will jump to the next line
		**sample results:**
			text here
			text hereafter
			{{.\pasted_image003.png}}	# returns ALL matches, even if not exact

	**grep -w "text here" file.txt**
		results will only be exact matches to what is in quotations
		**sample results:**
			text here
			{{.\pasted_image004.png}}
	
	**grep -wi "text here" file.txt**
		results are still the exact phrase, but case insensitive
		**sample results:**
			text here
			Text Here
			{{.\pasted_image005.png}}
	
	**grep -win "text here" file.txt**
		results are still the case insensitive exact phrase, this time with the line number added.
		**sample results:**
			51:text here
			413:Text Here
			{{.\pasted_image006.png}}
			
	**grep -win -B 4 "text here" file.txt**
		results are the case insensitive exact phrase, with the number lines, plus the **four lines prior to** (**-B 4)** the line where the exact phrase was found. **4 can be changed to any number.**
		{{.\pasted_image007.png}}
		
		**NOTE: doing "-A 4" instead of "-B 4" will return the four lines that follow the match instead of the four lines before the match.**
		
		**NOTE 2: doing "-C 4" will return the four lines before AND after the match**
		
		
**Search Entire Directories for Text:**
		**grep -win "hello" [[./*]]**
			returns exact, case insensitive matches with their line numbers, for any files that contain the word **hello**
			{{.\pasted_image008.png}}
			
		
		**Search for Different Types of Files Within a Directory:**
			#good for excluding subdirectories from searches, if so desired
			**grep -win "hello" [[./*.txt]]**
				returns ONLY the text files in the current directory that have **hello** in them
				{{.\pasted_image009.png}}


**Recursive Search for a Text:**
		**grep -winr "hello" [[./*]]**
				returns a set of recursive search results with exact matches, case insensitive, and line numbers added
				**NOTE: recursive searches can take a long time if there are many files or directories**
				{{.\pasted_image010.png}}
				

**Only Return Filenames with Matches:**
		**grep -wirl "hello" .**
			returns recursive search results (**r**) that are exact matches (**w**) and are case insensitive (**i**), but only the filenames themselves (**l**)
			{{.\pasted_image011.png}}


**Return Filenames with the Number of Matches in the File:**
		**grep -wirc "hello" .**
			return recursive search results that are exact matches, case insensitive, but only the filenames themselves and how many times the match occurs in the file.
			{{.\pasted_image.png}}
			{{.\pasted_image001.png}}			#**6 == the number of times "num" appears in "Bite_280.py"**
			

**Use "|" and "history" to search Git:**
		**history | grep "git commit"**
		{{.\pasted_image002.png}}


**Use "|" to further narrow your search:**
		**history | grep "git commit" | grep "23"**
		{{.\pasted_image012.png}}
		
		**IMPORTANT: The "|" character allows you to narrow, or focus, your search.**
		
		

**Grep with Regex:**
	**grep "...-...-...." file.txt**
		uses a regex to search for text, in this case a phone number
		{{.\pasted_image013.png}}
		
	
	**How to Use Python Regexes in the Terminal With Grep:**
		**grep -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" file.txt or [[./*]]**
			returns the results of the search using regex. The **-P** allows you to use regex as you would in Python to do the search.
