====== How to Use the cURL command ======
Created Sunday 06 December 2020

The **cURL** command allows us to query URLs from the command line:
	- make typical requests
	- post form data
	- authenticate users
	- save responses to files

Among other things, it is useful when testing REST API's, etc.

**1). Simple cURL command:										#note: do NOT use quotes on websites**
	**curl "**https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/forms/radio-button/"
		- returns all of the html, scripts, formatting, etc. for the web page

**2). cURL command on API or something that returns a json response:**
	**curl "**https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/forms/radio-button/"
		- will return the contents of the JSON file

**3). cURL command to return contents of response and the response header:		# -i includes header and content**
	**curl -i "website here"**
		- returns the header with information about the response type AND the content

**4). cURL to Post, Update, or Delete information from a web page:**
	**curl -d "first=Corey&last=Schafer" website here**
		- returns **You sent a POST request**
		- returns a dictionary with **{'last': u'Schafer', 'first': u'Corey'}**
			//i.e. the TYPE of request AND the DATA you posted//
			{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

	**update data:**
		**curl -X PUT -d "first=Corey&last=Smith" website here**
			- returns **You sent a PUT request**
			- returns the same dictionary as above, except with the last name set to **Smith**
			{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
			
	**delete data:**
		**curl -X DELETE website here**
			- returns **You sent a DELETE request**
			{{.\pasted_image004.png}}


**5). Make a request to a site that requires authentication:**
	**curl -u "username:password website here**
		- returns access to the site
		{{.\pasted_image005.png}}
		

**6). Download a File:**
	**curl -o test.txt	website here**
		- downloads the specified file
		{{.\pasted_image006.png}}
		
		{{.\pasted_image007.png}}
		# notice how I named the file "bird.jpg" instead of downloading it as the name it has on the website
