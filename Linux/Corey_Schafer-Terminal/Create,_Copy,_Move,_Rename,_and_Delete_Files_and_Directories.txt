====== Create, Copy, Move, Rename, and Delete Files and Directories ======
Created Wednesday 02 December 2020

**mkdir dirname**
	creates a new, empty directory at the path specified. If you are in a subdirectory, it will create a directory inside of the subdirectory

**touch filename.extension**
	creates a new file at the path specified. If no path is specified, it creates the file in the present working directory. 
	

**cp text.txt path/to/file**
	copies the content of the first file to the new file. New file does not have to have the same name. If desired, use a full path to copy the file to a different directory.


**mv text.txt original_file.txt**
	the **mv** command will move a file AND rename it if so desired. If you only want to rename it, don't use any paths (stay in same directory). If you want to move it to a new directory, you need to specify a path for the second file. If the first file is not in your current path, you will need to specify a path for that as well
	
	**Only want to move the file?**
		**mv text.txt path/to/new_directory**
		
	**Want to move and rename the file?**
		**mv text.txt . . / orig_file.txt**
		this moves the **text.txt** file back one directory and renames it to **orig_file.txt**
		

**rm filename.txt**
	removes the file, provided you are in the correct path. 
	**NOTE: once you remove from the terminal, there is no going back. There is no "Trash Can" to recover from.**
	

**Copy One Directory Over to Another:**
		1). make sure the directory being copied to exists.
				If it doesn't, then **mkdir new_dir_name**
		
		2). run **cp -R dirname new_dir_name**
		

**Rename a Directory:**
	**mv "TestDir "OrigDir**
	renames the first directory as the second directory
	

**Move a Directory:**
	**mv dirname path/to/dirname **
	if **dirname** is kept the same, it will just move **dirname **to the path specified in the second argument
	
	
**Move and Rename a Directory:**
	**cd dirname**
	**mv dirname path/to/new_dir_name**
	

**Remove a Directory:**
	**rm -R dirname**
	

**Force a Directory to be Deleted:**
	if you try to delete a directory and you get error messages, but you really want to delete it, you can run **rm -rf dirname**
	the **f** means "force delete"
