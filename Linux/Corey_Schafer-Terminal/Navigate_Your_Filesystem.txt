**Get Info About Directories:**

**ls -a**
	lists all files in your directory (not long form), including dot files
	
**ls -la**
	lists all files, including dot files, in **long list form**. (will tell you whether or not the item is a directory and what permissions you have)
	



**Change Directories:**

**cd . . / . . **
	**. .** is a relative path. Doing **cd . .** will take you one step back to the parent directory of the directory you are in
	
	Doing **cd . . / . .** will take you two paths back.....**cd . . / . . / . . **will take your three directories back, and so on
	
	
**cd -**
	will take you back to the last directory you were in. Almost works as a toggle switch if you need to go back and forth between two directories.
	

**cd or cd ~**
	will take you to the **home** directory
	**NOTE: can also use the "~" as a starting point. See the picture below:**
