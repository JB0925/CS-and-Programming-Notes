**Change Permissions of a List of Files That Have r/w/x Permissions:**
	**find Website-Demo -exec chown superuser:www-data { } \:				#** \: could also be +
	
	the above finds the Website-Demo directory, and uses the **-exec** (execute) command on **chown** (change owner), and sets the new owner to **superuser** and the group to **www-data**
	curly brackets are placeholders
	end the command in either **\: ** or **+ **(just personal preference)
	
	
**Change Permissions of a List of Folders That Have r/w/x Permissions:**
	**find dirname -type d -exec chmod 775 { } +**
		1). **find dirname -** find the directory, if it exists
		2). **-type d** - specifies that we are looking for directories, not files
		3). **-exec chmod 775 - **once you find the folder, execute (**-exec**) the **chmod** command on it, with the code of **775. (775**
			means the owner has full read / write / execute / search permissions on the directory, and any other user has read / execute / search permissions).
		4). include the **placeholder token { } **to capture the results, and either a **\: **or **+ **end the command
		

**More Changing File Permissions with Multiple Commands:**
	**664 = Owner** can read and write, but not execute. **Group **can read and write, but not execute. **Others **can read, but not write or execute.
	
	**find dirname -type f -exec chmod 664 { } +**
	


**Delete All Image Files That End With .jpeg:**
	**find . -type f -name *.jpeg**
	
	**find . -type f -name *.jpeg -maxdepth = 1				**#these commands find the files, which is helpful for double 													  checking so that you don't delete something permanently that you
																	  may need again one day
	
	1). **find . -type f -name *.jpeg**
		find all files in the current directory that end in .jpeg
	2). **-maxdepth = 1**
		search only in the pwd
		
	**changing the maxdepth tells the command how many directories back to search, i.e. "-maxdepth 3" says to search back through the current directory and its two parent directories**
	
	
	
	//**Actually Delete the Files:**//
		**find . -type f -name "*.py" maxdepth 1 -exec rm { } +**
		1). find the files in the present working directory that have a **.py** ending, only searching the pwd **(maxdepth 1)**
		2). **-exec rm { } +	**executes the remove command (**rm)** on the above found files, uses the **{ }** as a placeholder to store the results, and ends the command with a +
	

**Search for Information in a Case Insensitive Way:**
	- **find . -type f -iname "something*" **
