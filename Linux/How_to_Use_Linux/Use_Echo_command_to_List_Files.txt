====== Use Echo command to List Files ======
Created Tuesday 19 January 2021

say you want all of the files in a directory that start with a particular letter.

You can list these with the **echo** command:
	**1). echo p***
		the above will print all of the files that start with the letter **p** in the current directory
	
	**2). echo "../../bin/p***
		the above will list all the files that start with **p, **but this time in the directory that is two back of the **pwd** and in the folder called **bin**
	
	**Use Question Marks to Search for a Number of Letters:**
	**3). echo '../../bin/???**
		find all three letter long files in a directory by using 3 question marks:
			- the first example shows an example of what **#2** looks like on this page, and the last example shows what **#3** looks like
