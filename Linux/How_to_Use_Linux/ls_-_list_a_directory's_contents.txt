d = is a directory
rwx = read, write, execute permissions
- indicates that the given user does not have permission to do something, so **-xr** means the user does not have permission to write/create new files in that directory

**Write permissions:**
	in order to write to a file in a directory, you must also have write permissions on the directory the file is in (and any parent directories)
	
**execute permissions on a directory:**
	this means "search" or "are you allowed to enter this directory?"
	if you want to cd into a directory, you must have the  "execute" permission on the directory, and all of the directory's parent directories
