copy files with **cp**


takes two paths (absolute paths) -> path you want to copy from, to the path you want to copy to

**Example:**
	**cp dotfiles.md [[../foo.md]]				**#created a copy of "dotfiles.md" in the previous directory named "foo.md"
	
	**cp path/to/dotfiles.md path/to/foo.md		**#creates a copy of "dotfiles.md" in the directory listed in the second argument, named "foo.md"
