====== Single Quotes vs. Double Quotes ======
Created Wednesday 26 May 2021

If we wrap text in **double quotes**, the shell will respect spacing given to text between the quotes, and will ignore special characters except for:
	- **$**
	- **\**
	- **`     (the backtick, or what you use for string template literals in JS)**
	

- Pathname and brace expansion, as well as word splitting, will be ignored inside of double quotes

- Inside of **double quotes**, command substitution and arithmetic expansion are still performed because dollar signs still have meaning

**Some Examples:**
	- **echo hello					there**
	returns **hello there**
	
	- **echo "hello					there"**
	returns **hello					there**
	
	- **echo "hello					there{1,2,3}"**
	returns **hello					there{1,2,3}**
	- **echo hello					there{1,2,3}**
	returns **hello					there1 there2 there3**
	



**Single Quotes:**
	- single quotes suppress all forms of substitution
	
	**Example:**
		- in double quotes:
			**echo "today is				$(date +"%m-%d-%Y")"**
				returns **today is				05-26-2021**
		
		- in single quotes, it returns:
			**today is						      $(date)**
