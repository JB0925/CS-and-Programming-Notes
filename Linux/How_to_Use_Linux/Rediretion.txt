**Symbols:**
	- **>** redirect stdout
	- **< **redirect stdin
	- **> > **append
	
	**NOTE: **If you are writing to a file that already has data, you MUST use append if you don't want to lose that data.

**Examples:**
	**sort -n numbers.txt > myFile.txt**
	- takes the output from the **sort** command and redirects it to write to **myFile.txt**
	
	**sort colors.txt > > myFile.txt**
	- now that **myFile.txt** has data, we **append** to it using **> >**
	- adds the output from sorting **colors.txt** to the existing data in **myFile.txt**
	
	
**Redirect Stdin:**
	**cat < numbers.txt**
	- same as **cat numbers.txt**, but is more useful once **piping** is used
	

**Redirect Stdin and Stdout Together:**
	**cat < orig.txt > new.txt**
	- this sends the data from **orig.txt** as **stdin** for **cat** to use, and then redirects the output to write to **new.txt**
	- same as **cat orig.txt > new.txt**
	


**Redirect Stderr:**
	**cat orig.txt 2> new.txt**
	- this sends the standard error of **orig.txt** to 
	  **new.txt**
	

**Redirect Stdout and Stderr together:**
	**cat orig.txt > new.txt 2>&1**
	- this sends the **stdout** of the **cat** command's input to **new.txt** and, if there is an error, will also send that to **new.txt**
	
	
	Another Way in Newer Bash Versions:
		**cat orig.txt &> new.txt**
