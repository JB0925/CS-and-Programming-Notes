====== Foolproof Way to Exit a Program ======
Created Monday 18 January 2021

**If you are caught in a process that you can't get out of:**
	- open another terminal
	- use command **htop** to see all the running processes
	- scroll down until you find the process that you can't exit
	- once there, press **F9**
	- scroll down to **SIGKILL (number 9)** and press Enter
	- This kills the process in the other window
