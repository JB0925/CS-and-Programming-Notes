to change the file permissions for a given file, you can use **chmod:**

1). **+ or - = add or take away permissions**

2). **rwxXst = (read, write, execute file (or search for a directory), execute only if it's already a file or already has permissions for some other user, set user or group ID on execution, restricted deletion flag or sticky bit)**

**chmod + x 		**#add execute file permissions to this user for this file

**chmod -w		**#take away write to file privileges for a user
