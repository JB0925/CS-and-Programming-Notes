====== Root User ======
Created Thursday 12 November 2020

The Root user has almost all permissions available to them.

You will not normally log in as the root user, because it is too easy to break things.


Instead, you will use the command **"sudo"** to "do something as the root user"



**Example:**
		**How to change your screen's brightness:**
		
		**sudo** find -L [[/sys/class/backlight]] -maxdepth 2 -name '*brightness*'
		cd [[/sys/class/backlight/thinkpad_screen]]
		echo 3 | **sudo** tee brightness
		echo what are you saying | **sudo** tee somefile.txt
