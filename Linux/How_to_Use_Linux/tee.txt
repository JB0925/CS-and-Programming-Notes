Created Wednesday 26 May 2021

**tee** creates a new file and **redirects stdout, which can be useful with a "pipe" command:**

**Example:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/tee command.png}}
	
	
	This command send **numbers.txt** to **stdin**, and used a "**pipe**" to send that to a file created with **tee**. 
	That file is called **sorted_numbers.txt**. **tee** also sends the **stdout** from **sorted_numbers.txt** to the **sort -nr** command.
	The output is all of the numbers in **numbers.txt** are now sorted, but the files do not have their numbers sorted.
