====== cal - current month calendar ======
Created Sunday 10 January 2021

the command **cal** will give a calendar of the current month with the month name, year, all weeks, and today's date highlighted. 
Also includes the day of the week (SMTWTHFS)

typing **cal -j **will give the date in **julian days**, which is **the number of days since January 1st.**
	So, for example **February 1,2021 **would appear as **32** because it is the 32nd day of the year.
