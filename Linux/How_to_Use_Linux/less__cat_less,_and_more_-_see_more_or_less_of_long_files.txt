====== less  cat less, and more - see more or less of long files ======
Created Friday 15 January 2021

typing the command **cat "/etc/services **will output a long list of all the services on the system, with a brief description of them

to see only a portion at a time, use the "**|**" (pipe) and the **less** or **more** commands

**Examples:**
	**cat "/etc/services | more**
		returns a truncated version of the file's contents. Press enter to see one more line at a time from the file.
		Press spacebar to see one page at a time.


To exit, you can use **q** or **Ctrl-C**.



**How to Use Less:**
	- using the command **cat "/etc/services | less** will return something that looks very similar to what the **more** command did above, but with **less** you can use arrows to scroll, and you cannot do that with **more**
       
	   - the letter **j** can be used to scroll down one line at a time
	- the letter **k** can be used to scroll up one line at a time
	- the **spacebar** allows you to scroll one page at a time
	- lowercase **g** will take you to the beginning of a document
	- uppercase **G** will take you to the end of a document
	- lowercase **b** will let you scroll one page backward
	- uppercase **N** will print line numbers along with the rest of the output


**Using more or less on Other Files in Your File System:**
	- simply typing **more filename.txt** or **less thatfile.py** will also display the contents of your file
	- this is similar to **cat** **filename.txt**



**Using Less to Search:**
	when viewing a long list of files or directories, using **less** can be helpful, but it can also be helpful because it will allow you to search for information
	
	use **ls "/usr/bin | less** to get all of the files and directories inside of "/usr/bin".
	- this will allow to nicely scroll up and down as before, but it also allows you to **search**
	
	**Less Search Commands:**
		Forward Search - **/ search terms		(**search ahead of your cursor's current position)
		Backward Search - **? search terms		(**search behind your cursor's current position)
		
		Get More Matches (if any) - **lowercase n**
		Go Back to Previous Matches - **uppercase N**
		


**Using Less and Getting Line Numbers and Other Statistics:**
	using the commands **ls "/usr/bin | less -NM** will return the same nicely formatted, scrollable list as above, but this time with **Line Numbers**
