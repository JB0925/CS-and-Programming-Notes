====== pipe character ======
Created Monday 16 November 2020

**pipe character "|" means:**
		**take the output of the program to the left, and make it the input of the program to the right**
		

**Examples:**
	**ls -l /** 			#gives the content of the root directory
	**tail -n(num) filename_here**		#gives the last line(s) of whatever file is passed to it
	
	**Combined with pipe character:**
		**ls -l / | tail -n1			#**gives the last line of a directory listing 

		**ls -l / | tail -n1 > ls.txt		**#writes the last line of the root directory to a file in the current directory called ls.txt
