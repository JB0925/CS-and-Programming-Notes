**How to Handle Errors with Find:**

Sometimes, if you search for a file, you will get "permission denied" errors.

You can handle these so that you don't have to see them in two ways:

**1). find . -name "*.txt" 2 > file.txt**
		- this will write any error messages to a "file.txt" you are creating in the **pwd**

**2). find . -name "*.txt" 2> '/dev/null**
		- this will do the same as above, but sends the messages to a file where things are lost forever
