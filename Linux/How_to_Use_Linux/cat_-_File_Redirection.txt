====== cat - File Redirection ======
Created Thursday 12 November 2020

to write to a new (or existing) text file:
		**echo something here > filename.txt**


to append more information to a file:
		**echo new info here Â» filename.txt**

to copy the contents of one file from that file to another file:
		**cat < filename1.txt > filename2.txt				**#erases the second file if something was already there
		**cat < filename1.txt > > filename2.txt				    **#appends **filename1.txt's** contents to **filename2** (no space between angle brackets)

to see the content of a file:
		**cat filename.whatever**
		//will print the file's contents//
		
		**OR**
		
		**cat < filename.whatever**
		//same as directly above//

to begin writing to a brand new file:
	**cat > new_file.txt**
	
	this will prompt you with some blank lines so you can enter text.
	From here, you can write and when you finish, you can press **Ctrl-D**.
	**OR**, if you are at the beginning of a new line and have not typed anything, you only need to press **Ctrl-D** once.
