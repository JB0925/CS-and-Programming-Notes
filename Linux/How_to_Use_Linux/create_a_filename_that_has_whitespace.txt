====== create a filename that has whitespace ======
Created Friday 15 January 2021

~$ **my file** will create two different files, one called "my" and another called "file"

~$ **my\ file** will create one file called "my file"


another option is to use touch and single quotes i.e. : **touch 'my file'**




This works the same way with removing / rm: 	either use the \ character or single quotes.
