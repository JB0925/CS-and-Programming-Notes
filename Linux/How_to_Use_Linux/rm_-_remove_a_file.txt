====== rm - remove a file ======
Created Friday 13 November 2020

call **rm filename_here **to remove a file. You need to be in the directory where the file is to make this happen, or type the path to the file.

You cannot remove directories with just **rm**, but you can use the **-r** flag, which would allow you to do it via recursive removal


**rm -ri folder_name** will also remove directories recursively, but it will prompt you to ask what you want to do before removing them, i.e. "Are you sure you want to do this?"

To make the above process faster, if you know for sure that you want to remove all of the files and directories it asks about, you can use the **yes** command, ala:

**yes | rm -ri folder_name**
