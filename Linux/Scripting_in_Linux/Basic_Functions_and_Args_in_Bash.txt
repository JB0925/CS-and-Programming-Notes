====== Basic Functions and Args in Bash ======
Created Saturday 28 November 2020

The following code creates a function called **mcd** that uses mkdir to create a directory and immediately cd's into it:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
**NOTE: **notice how the prompt doesn't show up until you close the curly brace. This is how you know you are still writing your function.

The following picture shows an example of what happens when you call the function with an argument:
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
Notice how as soon as I ran the command, it created "bites" and cd'ed into that directory


**BASH VARIABLES:**

Bash uses a variety of special variables to refer to arguments, error codes, and other relevant variables. Below is a list of some of them:
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

**NOTE: **when you run some of the above commands, you may get a number. **0** means everything went ok, any other number means an error probably occurred.

		the **$? **will return the exit code of the previous command
		**true** will always have a code of 0 and **false** will always return a code of 1
