====== Comparison Operators with the Equality Operator ======
Created Thursday 18 March 2021

Just like in Python, two "equals" signs means "**it is the same as" **and one equal sign is for assignment.


**StrictEquality:**
	= = =  (no spaces)
	
	In JS, a major difference is that == can mean that **3** == '**3'** is True. In Python, this is not so.
	
	However, if we use Strict Equality in JS, it checks for type and behaves much more like Python.
		**Strict Equality Syntax:**
			 = = =      (no spaces)
			
		In Strict Equality, **3 === '3' **is False, since they are the same value but **ARE NOT** the same type.
