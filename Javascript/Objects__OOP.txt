**Continue scrolling for more information.**
**NOTE: You can start with an empty object and add to it, either by using dot notation or bracket notation.**

**Example:**
	var ourDog = {
	   "name": "Lainey",
	   "legs": 4
	   "tails": 1,
	   "friends": ["everything!"]
	};
	
**NOTE: All number keys get stored as STRINGS.**
		**When using bracket notation, you can pass in "someObject[100], but it also turns the 100 into a string,**

**To access the object attributes, use dot notation, just like in Python.**
		ourDog.name; = 'Lainey'
		ourDog.legs; = 4
		etc., 
		

**Or you could also use bracket notation ([  ]) (You have to use bracket notation if there is whitespace within the attribute name.):**
		ourDog['name'];
			returns 'Lainey'
		
		ourDog['legs'];
			returns 4



**You can also use dot notation to update object attributes:**
		ourDog.legs = 2;




**Add new properties to an Object:**
	You can use either bracket or dot notation to create a new property for an object.
	
	**1).**
		ourDog.bark = true

	**2). **ourDog['bark'] = true
	


**Delete properties from an Object:**
	Use the **delete** keyword to delete a property from an Object.
	**Example:**
		**delete** ourDog.bark;
	
	
	if you then ran **console.log(ourDog.bark);**, you would either get an error, "undefined" or "null" returned.
