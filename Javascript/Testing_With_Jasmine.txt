====== Testing With Jasmine ======
Created Thursday 27 May 2021

Jasmine is a popular 'JavaScript testing framework.

There are others, such as Mocha and Jest, etc.

**Jasmine** has to be imported via a script tag.




**How to Set Up Jasmine:**
	Google Search **Jasmine JS Testing** or something similar. The background is a purplish color.
	
	Look for **Jasmine standalone**
	
	Click it and, inside of that link, you need to **copy the CDN files.** There should be **1 CSS file **and **3 scripts.**
	
	Like usual, the link tag goes in the HEAD of an HTML document.
	
	The **script tags** from Jasmine go at the bottom of the body **BEFORE** any self-created JS files.
	
	**JASMINE CDN UNPKG FILES:**
		CSS
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/jasmine-core/lib/jasmine-core/jasmine.css"/>
		
		JS
			<script src="https://unpkg.com/jasmine-core/lib/jasmine-core/jasmine.js"></script>
			<script src="https://unpkg.com/jasmine-core/lib/jasmine-core/jasmine-html.js"></script>
			<script src="https://unpkg.com/jasmine-core/lib/jasmine-core/boot.js"></script>
	
	
	It is good practice to separate your tests from the actual functions, etc., in your production code.
		- **make a file that has the same name as the file you are testing, BUT PUT .test IN THE NAME**
		
		**Example:**
			- You are testing the code written in **taxes.js**
			- You call your test file for taxes.js **taxes.test.js**
			- **INCLUDE** this script under the JS file that you wrote in the body of your HTML 
			- **NOTE:** You need to make a new, blank (**except for the typical HTML jargon**) HTML file to do your testing in.
