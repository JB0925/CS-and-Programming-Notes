====== Validating Instances ======
Created Monday 07 June 2021

**Example:**
	class `MyClass {
		constructor(a, b, c) {
			**let nums = [a,b,c].every(num => Number.isFinite(num) && num >= 0);**
			**if(!nums) {**
				**throw new Error ('You must pass in positive numbers!!')**
			**}**
			this.a = a;
			this.b = b;
			this.c = c;
		}
	}
	
	
	If you need to validate the data being passed in, you can check for a condition and throw an error if the condition isn't met. 
	If you don't do this, you can end up with bad data.
	
	If you just say **return**, the instance of the class will be created, but it will be blank...which is not helpful.
