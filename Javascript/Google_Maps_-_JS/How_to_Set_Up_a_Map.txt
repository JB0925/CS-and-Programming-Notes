Go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript

Scroll down til you see the "example".

From there, you can cut and paste your example into your code. The example looks much like the Mapquest.js example.

Scroll Down to the Example

**Things You'll Need:**
1). Script tags in the head and body of the HTML doc

2). a div (or similar) in the body with an **id** of "**map**".

3). CSS defined for the div mentioned above. Need to set a defined height and width.

4). The JS to create the map. Remember, the "center" would be where the starting coordinates go.
