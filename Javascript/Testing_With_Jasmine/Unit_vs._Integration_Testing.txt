====== Unit vs. Integration Testing ======
Created Friday 28 May 2021

**Unit Tests:**
	- narrow in scope
	- going to verify that a small piece of code (maybe a function) does what it is supposed to do
	- they are simple and cheap / easy to write
	- work well with **pure functions** that do not have side effects
	- **example: **verify that a single function returns an expected value based on an argument

**Integration Test:**
	- broader in scope
	- verifies that multiple modules / functions work well together
	- more complex and costly to maintain
	- **example: **verify the dependencies between functions are working together to produce an expected value
