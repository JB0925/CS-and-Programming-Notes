====== Clean Up or Roll Back After Testing ======
Created Friday 28 May 2021

Many times, after testing, we need to clean up after our tests.
	- maybe we used a DB and we want to remove data that we committed
	- maybe we added fake users to our DB, etc.
	

**Jasmine** has a function called **afterEach **that, after each test gets run, will fire. You provide the code:
	**afterEach(function() {**
		**input.value = '';**
		**DELETE FROM myTable**
		**WHERE id = 1;**
	});
	
	So, after each test ran, the **afterEach** code would run and perform the operations inside of the code block.
