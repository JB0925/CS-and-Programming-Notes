====== Jasmine Matchers ======
Created Thursday 27 May 2021

**toEqual()**
	- checks for equality, i.e. "**does it look the same?"**
	- does NOT care about memory references

**toBe()**
	- checks for one item to have the same reference as another, **if those items are objects, arrays, etc.**
	- using **toBe()** to check for equality with strings, numbers, etc., will work because **JS considers one primitive to be the same as another, as long as their values are the same**


**toContain()**
	- does an object or array contain the item in parentheses?
	- **expect(COLORS).toContain('red');**
	

**.not**
	- added before another matcher to check to make sure something isn't true, or isn't happening


**toBeInstanceOf()**
	- same as **isinstance()** in Python
	- **expect(makeString(['h','e','l','l','o'])).toBeInstanceOf(String);**


**toThrowError()**
	- way to test and see if a function will throw an error as the intended result
	- **expect(() => {calculateTaxes('asfkahgsdg')}).toThrowError('Your error message goes here');**
	- **NOTE:** The use of the arrow function in the beginning of the function. It is used to capture the resuls of the test, and 
	saves it from throwing errors on other, untested functions
	

There are many more if you check the Jasmine docs.
