====== What Should You Test ======
Created Friday 28 May 2021

Test every function in at least one way.
Think about edge cases.
	- what if the list is empty?
	- what about non-integer numbers?
	- what about negative numbers?
	- etc.,
	
	
Try to write code that is easier to test!

Don't mix logic and UI in a single function.
