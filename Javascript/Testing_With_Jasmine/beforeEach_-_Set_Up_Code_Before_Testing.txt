====== beforeEach - Set Up Code Before Testing ======
Created Friday 28 May 2021

**beforeEach** is the opposite of **afterEach**

**beforeEach** sets up some pieces of code before each **it** function is called

**beforeEach(() => {**
	**input.value = 'hello there';**
	**myArray = [1,2,3];**
**});**


So, before each **it** function runs, the above code would run and **set up ** the test.
