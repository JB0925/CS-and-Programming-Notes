====== beforeAll ======
Created Friday 28 May 2021

**beforeAll** is like **beforeEach**, except that it runs the code inside of its block **only one time** , which is before any test has run.

This is often used to create a **testing database**, so that you don't have to use your production database, and potentially damage what you have stored in it.

**Syntax:**
	**beforeAll(() => {**
		**console.log('hey!!!'**
	**});**
	
	The above would run **hey!!!** one time before any tests had run.
