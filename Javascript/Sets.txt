====== Sets ======
Created Saturday 05 June 2021

Sets are much like they are in Python, just not as robust.
They still only save unique values.

**Create a New Set:**
	let mySet = new Set();


**Set Methods:**
	**mySet.add(value or iterable);**
		adds a new value to a set
	
	**mySet.has(value)l**
		checks to see if a value is in a set
	
	**mySet.size;**
		returns the length of the Set
	
	**mySet.clear();**
		wipes out the entire Set
	
	**mySet.delete(value);**
		removes one value from a Set


**Iteration Methods:**
	**mySet.keys();**
		returns an array like object that can be looped over, but is not an array
	
	**mySet.values();**
		same as above
	
	**mySet.entries();**
		returns an array-like object that contains an array of **[value, value]** for each value in the Set.
