====== Data Types and Variables ======
Created Tuesday 16 March 2021

**There are 7 different data types you can use in Javascript:**
	- undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
		- **undefined: **a variable that hasn't been set to anything yet
		- **null**: like **None** in Python
		- **boolean**: True or False
		- **symbol:** immutable primitive value that is unique
		- **number: **a number
		- **object: **can store key-value pairs
		


**How to declare a variable:**
	- You can use **var** keyword, i.e. **var myName = "Jesse"**
		- after this initial declaration, you can change the variable to something else
	
	- You can use **let **keyword, i.e. **let myName = "Jesse"**
	
	- You can use **const**, as in **const pi = 3.14**
	
	
	**Var can be used throughout your whole program.**
	
	**"let" can only be used within the scope of where you declared it.**
	
	**"const" is a variable that you cannot change.**
