====== How To Start an HTML Page with JS on WSL2 ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

Create an **app.js** file.

Create an **index.html** file in the same directory (for now) as the **app.js** file.

Save everything and, from either the terminal OR the VSCode window, run **wslview index.html** or whatever your html file name is.

**NOTE:** to see any JS, Ctrl+Shift+i and click **console**
