====== Ternary Operator or Ternary Conditional ======
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

A **ternary operator** is an **if / else** statement squeezed into one line of code, though the syntax is very different.

**Example:**
	Here is a conditional using **if / else **syntax:
	
	if (num === 3) {
	   return "dumb"
	}
	else {
	   return "lucky"
	}

	**Here's what it would look like with a ternary conditional:**
		**num === 3 ? return "dumb": return "lucky";**



**Using a Ternary Operator to assign a Variable:**
	**Example:**
		let myVar = someOtherVar === 3 ? "word salad": "more words";
