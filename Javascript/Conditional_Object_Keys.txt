====== Conditional Object Keys ======
Created Friday 30 April 2021

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Conditional Keys For Objects.png}}

You can use **spread** and the AND operator to create a conditional key in your object.

**What does the above code say?**
	If you have **query.foo**, then your object **should have a KEY called "foo", **and set **query.foo** to that key.
	
	OR, if you have **query.bar**, make an entrry in your object where the key is **bar**, and the value is **query.bar**


**Another Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/More Conditional Keys JS.png}}

Here, we've created a function that takes two parameters, both of which are set to null initially. 

We set the API parameters. First, in goes the API key. 

Next, we are saying **if there is a "searchTerm", make the KEY "s" and the VALUE "searchTerm"**

**If there is an "id", make the KEY "i" and make the VALUE "id".**


You can also do something like:
	**...value === 's' && {s:searchTerm}**
	
	In this example, you are saying "**if your value is equal to "s", set the KEY to "s" and the VALUE to "searchTerm"**
