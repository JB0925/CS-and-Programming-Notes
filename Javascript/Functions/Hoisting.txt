When JS is running your code, it is taking all of your variables and treating them as being declared at the top of the page, then assigned later.

**Example:**
	console.log(animal);
	var animal = 'Tapir';
	
	**You would think this would throw an error saying that there is no variable animal, since animal is declared after the console.log() statement.**
	
	However, what happens when JS runs the code is, essentially, this:
		**var animal;**
		...
		...
		**console.log(animal);**
			returns **undefined**
		**animal = 'Tapir';**
	
	So it is treating it as though animal was already declared earlier in the program.
	

To avoid this, declare and initialize your variables **BEFORE** using them.

**NOTE: **Just like in block scope, where you can access a variable declared with **var (inside a function)** outside of a function, but you **can't do that with "let" and "const", HOISTING works the same way. **Only **var** will allow for this behavior.
