====== Callback Functions ======
Created Sunday 28 March 2021

A callback function is a function that is **passed in as an argument** to another function.

**Example:**
	function callBackFunction(func) {
		func()
		func()
	}
	
	#this is the callback
	function laugh() {
		return 'hahahahaha'
	}
	
	
	#the calling of the function
	console.log(callBackFunction(laugh));
		returns "hahahahaha"
				 "hahahahaha"


**Example Two:**
	In JavaScript, there is the **setTimeout()** function which, when called, will set a request to time out after so many seconds, and call a function once the time limit has been reached.
	
	function timesUp() {
		return alert("Sorry, time's up!!!")
	}
	
	
	**setTimeout(timesUp, 5000)**
		returns a response to the browser after 5 seconds (**5000 milliseconds**), in this case, it makes the alert window pop up in the browser saying "Sorry, time's up!!!"
	
	
	
**NOTE: It can also be an inline (lambda) function, similar to how you'd save a function in a variable.**
	setTimeout(function() {
		return alert('gogogogogo')
	}, 5000);


**These are really useful when using JS in the browser.**
