====== Hoisting With Functions ======
Created Monday 29 March 2021

Functions are also hoisted and can be accessed before they are written. Think of the function as being declared at the top of the document. 
If called before declaration, it will still return what it is meant to return.

**NOTE:** This does not work with **function expressions**, i.e. creating and storing a function in a vaariable all at once.
