====== Arguments Keyword and Rest ======
Created Wednesday 14 April 2021

'JavaScript has an **arguments** keyword that can be used within functions. It creates an array-like structure that can be looped through, but is otherwise fairly hard to use.

**Example:**
	def myFunc (name, date, photo, comment) {
	   for (arg of **arguments**) {
		  console.log(arg)
	   }
	};


The above example would print out every one of the arguments passed in to **myFunc()**, collected together in an array-like structure called **arguments**.



**A better way to do this is with the Rest method.**

**Example:**
	function myFunc (...details) {
	   for (detail of details) {
		  if (detail.includes('2') {
			 console.log(detail)
		  }
		   }
		 };



**Example 2:**
	function myFunc (first, last, ...details) { etc.,
	
	
	In this example, the first and last parameters will NOT be part of your array, They will be their own separate arguments.
