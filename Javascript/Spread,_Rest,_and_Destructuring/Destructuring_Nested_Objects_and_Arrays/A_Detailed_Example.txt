{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Nested Array Destructuring .png}}

Here, we have a **movies array**. We want to access the second person, Susan, in the **actors** array, nested inside of **movies[1]**.

At the bottom, you see we:
	1). started with a **[**
	2). used a comma (**,**) to bypass the first position (**movies[0]**) in the array
	3). used destructuring on the second object. Because it is an object, we used **{}**
	4). we use the **actors** key. and we access the array that is its value:
		**actors: [, person2]**
		Here, we also skipped the first person in the **actors** array
	
	5). we close off the destructuring with **}] = movies**, as movies is the original array.
	


**Destructuring an Object Nested Inside of Another Object:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Destructuring a Nested Object.png}}

Here, we still access the second item in the array (noted by the **,**).

Then, we access the **second object** with **{actors:**

Then, we get the **key** **"person2"** from the object nested inside of it.

Because all of it is still inside of an array, we still have to use array brackets on it.
