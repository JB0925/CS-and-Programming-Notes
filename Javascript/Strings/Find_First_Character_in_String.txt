====== Find First Character in String ======
Created Wednesday 17 March 2021

Just like in Python, you can get the first character of a string using bracket notation and indexing:


var someVar = 'Hello';

console.log(someVar[1])
	- **this would return "e"**, **for the letter at index 1 of the word.**
