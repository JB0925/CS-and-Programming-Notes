====== Declaring String Variables ======
Created Tuesday 16 March 2021

**Declaring a string:**
	var **myString;**
	
**Assigning a string:**
	**myString = "Alan Turing";**
	

**Declaring and assigning at the same time:**
	**var myString = 'Alan Turing';**
	


**NOTE: **Strings can be assigned, just like in Python, using single or double quotes, or backticks (not like Python).
		Strings can also be concatenated with the **+** operator, just like in Python.
		Strings can also be concatenated with the += operator.
		
		Just like Python, you can concatenate strings with variables:
			**var myName = "Jesse";**
			**var sentence = "My name is " + myName + ". Nice to meet you!"**
