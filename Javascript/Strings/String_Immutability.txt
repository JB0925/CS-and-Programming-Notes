====== String Immutability ======
Created Wednesday 17 March 2021

Just like in Python, strings are immutable. This DOES NOT mean you can't change a string.

It does mean that individual characters do not support assignment, i.e. no **myString[3] = 's';**


To change the character at index 3, you'd have to basically reassign the variable to whatever you want to entire string to be.


**Example:**
	var myString = 'Jello World';
		**Can't do myString[0] = 'H';**
	
	myString = 'Hello World';
		**This is how you change it.**
