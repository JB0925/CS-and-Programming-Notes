====== Find Length of String ======
Created Wednesday 17 March 2021

Akin to **len( )** in Python, Javascript uses the **.length** property.


**Example:**
	var cuteDog = 'You have a cute dog.";
	var count = 0;
	
	count = cuteDog.length;
	
	run **console.log(count)** and it should return 20, counting whitespace as well.
