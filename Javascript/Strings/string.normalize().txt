====== string.normalize() ======
Created Sunday 04 July 2021

Sometimes, string that look exactly the same and are the same length do not evaluate as being the same.

This is because, sometimes, the character codes behind the letters do not match up.

To make them the same, use **.normalize()**

**Example:**
	return **string1.normalize() === string2.normalize()**
