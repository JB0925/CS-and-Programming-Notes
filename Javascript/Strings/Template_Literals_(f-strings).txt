====== Template Literals (f-strings) ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

Just like f-strings in Python, you can pass in **number** values, etc., to format into a string.

**NOTE: **You **HAVE TO **use backticks to surround your string. The backtick is on the tilde key.

The syntax is **${var_name or expression}**

**Example:**
	let myNum = 8;
	console.log(`My daughter is **${myNum}** years old.`)
		returns **My daughter is 8 years old.**
