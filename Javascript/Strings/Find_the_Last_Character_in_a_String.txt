====== Find the Last Character in a String ======
Created Wednesday 17 March 2021

Finding the last character in a string is similar to Python, but you can't use the -1 index.

To find the last character, you use the **.length** attribute.


**Example:**
	var lastChar = myString[**myString.length -1**]
	
	Again, we use **length - 1** because of the zero based indexing.
	
	
	To find the 3rd to last letter, you just change to [**myString.length - 3**], etc.
