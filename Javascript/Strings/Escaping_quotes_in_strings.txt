====== Escaping quotes in strings ======
Created Tuesday 16 March 2021

Just like in Python, to escape a literal, you need to use the backslash character.

With a string:
	**"I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes.\""**
		Will return **I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes."**
		


OR


**Just Use Single Quotes to Start Your String:**
	**'I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes." '**



OR


**Use Backticks:**
	` **Now I can use 'single quotes' and "double quotes" inside of the string. `**
