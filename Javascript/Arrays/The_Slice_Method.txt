====== The Slice Method ======
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

Slice is like doing list slicing in Python.

**myLst[3:6]   **in [[JavaScript]] is **myLst.slice(3, 6)**
	returns a new list that is a subset of the original list
	- does not modify the original list
	- is not inclusive, so just like in Python, you have to provide a final index that is one greater than the final value you want.
	
	- **NOTE: You can also pass in negative indices to slice()**. For example, **.slice(-1)** will return an array with the last element in the original array, and **.slice(-4, -1)** will return an array with the values starting at index **-4, **and ending at **index -1 (non inclusive)**
