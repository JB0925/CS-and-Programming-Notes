**First Example:**
	setting a variable, **movie**, to a callback function that will iterate through an array and return the **first** instance of the movie that **includes** the string '**Mrs.**'
		In other words, the **movie** variable will be the name of the **first** movie that includes the string **Mrs.**


**Second Example:**
	**movie2** will be the **first** movie name where the **.find** function finds the movie name where the **Mrs.** string is at index 0.
	

**On an Object:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

Here we have an array of objects. Below, we make the **constant** "boy". Boy is equal to the **first** myObject element that myObject finds that has an **age** attribute that is less than 20. 

When we console.log(boy), it returns the second object, where the **name** attribute is 'Tim'.
