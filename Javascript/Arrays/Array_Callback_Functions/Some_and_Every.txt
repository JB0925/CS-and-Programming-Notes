====== Some and Every ======
Created Tuesday 30 March 2021

These are equivalent to **any **and **all** in Python.
They return a boolean. **EVERY will return True if ALL values in the array meet the condition**, and **SOME will return True if even just ONE value meets the passed in criteria.**


**Example of Every:**
	const words = ['dog', 'cat', 'ball'];
	**words.every(word => {**
		**return word.length >= 3;**
	});
	
	This would return TRUE because every word is 3 letters long or greater.
	
	
	**words.every(word => word[0] === 'd');**
		This would return FALSE because only one word starts with **d.**
	
	
	**words.every(word => {**
		const last = word.length - 1;
		return word[last] === 'g'
	});
		**This would also return FALSE because only ONE word has an ending "g".**
