====== Array Callback Functions ======
Created Monday 29 March 2021

Arrays have many callback functions, such as **forEach()**. Just like a regular callback, you pass in a function as an argument and it will apply that function to every element in the array.

Some examples of **Array Callback Functions:**
	- forEach()
	- map()
	- filter()
	- find()
	- reduce()
	- some()
	- every()
