====== Join ======
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

**let myLst = ['D', 'O', 'O', 'R'];**
console.log(myLst);
	**returns "D, O, O, R"**
	
	The **separator** for join is a **comma** by default, but this can be changed, i.e. **myLst.join('$')** would join all letters in the array by a dollar sign.
