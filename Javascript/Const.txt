====== Const ======
Created Friday 26 March 2021

**Const **is a variable declaration method that allows you to declare a constant variable that should not change. 

If your variable is an array,  **You can modify the contents of const by using push, unshift, shift, etc.**

**You cannot set the entire array = a new array, because that would be changing the REFERENCE to the original array, and that is not allowed with an array that has been declared using the const method.**
