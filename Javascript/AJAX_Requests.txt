====== AJAX Requests ======
Created Wednesday 21 April 2021

AJAX = **Asynchronous 'JavaScript and XML**

Really, today, we use JSON instead of XML.

**AJAX requests are made when you make a request and the page doesn't refresh, but updates in place to reflect the results of the request you made.**


AJAX returns data in JSON format.

Javascript then gets that data and decides what to do with it in the browser.
