====== The Await Keyword ======
Created Friday 23 April 2021

We can only use the await keyword inside of a function declared with async.

**await** pauses the execution of the function, and waits for a Promise to be resolved.


**Example:**
	**async** function getPlanets() {
		const res = **await** axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');
		console.log(res.data)
	};
	
	
	In a normal function, this would require the use of **.then** and **.catch**, because Axios returns a promise, then we would tell our code what to do with what it returned. The console.log statement would run before the request was completed. **This would result in an error, because "res.data" isn't returned to us yet.**
	
	Here, the **await** keyword tells us to pause until Axios has brought back the data. 
	
	So Axios brings the data back and we wait to print the data out because of the **await** keyword.


**Another Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Movie Example Async and Await.png}}

Here, we are making the **event** an **async** function so that we can **await** the Axios call to the API. **This basically pauses our code until the Promise that Axios returns has been fulfilled and THEN we will print the list of movies.**
