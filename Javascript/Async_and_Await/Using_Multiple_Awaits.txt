====== Using Multiple Awaits ======
Created Friday 23 April 2021

Remember, the **async **and **await** keywords return a Promise by definition.

Because of this, when we use **async** and **await, **we do not have to use **.then** to chain methods together. Chaining **async** and **await** together is as simple as writing **await my code here**, followed by the next function call, etc.

**Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Chaining Async and Await Calls.png}}

Instead of many **then** clauses, we just use **await** in front of each call to move the button across the page.

To catch any errors, we move **catch** to the called function at the bottom and use it in a standard way.
