Created Sunday 01 August 2021

Debouncing is the process of waiting to some type of call. It is typically used on inputs, where a function fires as a user types.

`**searchCupcakesOnInput** makes an API call and adds its results to the DOM.

**debounce** adds a timeout that is cleared on each new input keystore

Finally, it is called at the bottom **searchInput.on('input'....)**
