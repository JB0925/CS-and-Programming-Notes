The keyword **new:**
	1). Creates an empty JS object.
	2). Sets the keyword **this** to be that object.
	3). Returns the object: **return this**
	4). Creates a link to the object's prototype.
	
Every fn has a property on it called **prototype**.

The prototype has a property called **constructor**, which points back to the function.

The **constructor** points back to the same function that it was created in.
