====== Closures ======
Created Wednesday 19 January 2022

A closure is the ability for **inner functions** to remember variables defined in **outer functions** long after the outer function has returned.

This is useful for encapsulating logic and creating private variables.

**Example:**

function idGenerator() {
  let start = 0;
  return function generate() {
	start++;
	return start;
  };
}

**let nextId = idGenerator();**

**nextId()**
	**// 1**

**nextId();**
	**// 2**

nextId is the **function that was returned** from **idGenerator**. It remembers the start variable and, because of that, is able to increment it by one each time we call it.
