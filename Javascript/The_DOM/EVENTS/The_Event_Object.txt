====== The Event Object ======
Created Monday 19 April 2021

**Example:**

	h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
	h1.addEventListener('click', function(**evt**) {
		**console.log(evt)**
		alert('hey, you clicked me!!!')
	});
	

When you use **addEventListener**, you have access to a callback object that has information about the event that happened. **This can be useful in things like keypress events, etc., where you might need to know what key was pressed. **You treat this object like any other object. To access it, you pass it into the **function** argument that **addEventListener** takes. You can call it **e, evt**, or **event**, or whatever you want. 

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
