Above is a basic HTML form.

**Using the Event Object's "PreventDefault" attribute and getting value from the form:**

1). Select the form object.


2). Add an "**addEventListener**" tag to the form. 


3). When you pass in the **function**, make sure to pass in the **event** object. 


4), Use **event.preventDefault()** to keep the form from submitting.


5). To get the values and print them:
	- select each input that you want information from **by its ID or class name**
	- for now, use **console.log(myVar.value);** to be able to see and access the information that is passed into the form's individual inputs.
	
	**NOTE: Use "myVar.checked" to get a "True" or "False" bool from a checkbox.**
