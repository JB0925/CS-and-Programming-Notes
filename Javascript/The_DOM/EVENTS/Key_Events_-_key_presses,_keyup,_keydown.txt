Created Monday 19 April 2021

Say we have an input in our HTML.

There are three different types of "**key**" events that can happen

1). Key up
2). Key press
3). Key down

**Example:**
	const input = document.querySelector('#username');
	
	input.addEventListener('keydown', function() {
		console.log('KEY DOWN!!!');
	}};
	
	
**KEY DOWN:**
	- fires any time a key is pressed (letters, numbers, space bar, caps lock, tab, etc.)
	- will continue to fire for as long as the key is held down
	- DOES WORK for keys that don't print anything on screen.
	

**KEY UP:**
	- fires once a key is let go.
	- only fires once
	- DOES WORK for keys that don't print anything on screen.


**KEY PRESS:**
	- only works with letters and numbers, and the enter key
	- does not work with arrow keys, shift key, etc.
	- **General rule: **Key press only works with keys that print something on the screen (even an empty space).
	


**NOTE: **In a **key** **event**, we **want** the event object that can be passed into the **addEventListener** function
