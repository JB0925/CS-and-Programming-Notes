====== Input and Change Events ======
Created Tuesday 20 April 2021

An **input** event allows you to capture data being passed into an input in real time. 


**Example:**

We already selected all of our relevant input elements (minus the submit one) **here**:

{{~/Desktop/Screen Shot 2021-04-20 at 11.36.45 AM.png}}


Now, we can create **input** event listeners for them. Here, I've created one for each one, and the data gets stored in an object:
{{~/Desktop/Screen Shot 2021-04-20 at 11.39.14 AM.png}}



In the console, if you run **formData** after every key press, it will update the **formData** object.

**NOTE: Again, we used "checked" to get the bool from the checked input type.**



**Example 2:**
	- getting all of the input elements and looping through them to add event listeners
	
	- **NOTE: This was a little wonky because a checkbox uses "checked" instead of "value", and the "veggies" input is not an actual input, so it had to be done separately.**
	
	**In the future, an easier way to do it would have been to group all three selected inputs above into a list and loop through them.**

**Change Events:**

	- **change events follow the same syntax as "input" events. **
	
	- The major difference is that while **input** events respond to every keystroke, **change** events respond when an input is clicked **out of focus (clicked off of) OR the ENTER key is pressed.**
	
	**Other than that, they behave the same way.**
