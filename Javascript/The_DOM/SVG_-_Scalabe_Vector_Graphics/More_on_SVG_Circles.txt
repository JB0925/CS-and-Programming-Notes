====== More on SVG Circles ======
Created Monday 26 April 2021

The middle of an SVG circle is called the **fill**.

The border of an SVG circle is called the **stroke**.

Above is an update as to what our circle will look like with these attributes.


**Adding in "stroke-dasharray":**

	**HTML:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Stroke-Dasharray.png}}
	
	**In-Browser:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Dashed SVG Circle.png}}
	
**NOTE: **You can pass in two numbers to **stroke-dasharray**. The first is the length of each dash. The second is the distance between dashes. **Passing in one number will set both properties.**

**stroke-dasharray="10 5"** means 10 pixel long dashes, with 5 pixel spaces inbetween.


**Circle Perimeter:**

We can find the perimeter of our circle with **2 * Math.PI * r**, so for our circle that would be **2 * Math.PI * 90 = 565.47....**

From there, we can manipulate how much of the circle gets a border, i.e. **565 * .5 = 282.74...**

So if we want half of the circle to have a border, we can use pass in **282.74** to **stroke-dasharray**.


**NOTE: **Circle borders ALWAYS start on the right side at the middle edge of the circle.


**STROKE-DASHOFFSET:**
	Using **stroke-dashoffset **gives an extra cushion of space to your **stroke-dasharray** setting. So if our circle is about **565px** in perimeter, and we set **stroke-dasharray="560"**, there will be a **5px** gap in our circle. 
	
	With **stroke-dashoffset**, this will widen that gap to whatever you set it to.
	
	**We will use stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset** to complete the animation of the circle.
