====== How to Make Changes to Multiple Elements ======
Created Saturday 17 April 2021

**How to iterate over a tag or tags that we got from querySelector or querySelectorAll, or getElementsByClass, etc.:**

Remember, these methods return an array-like object that **do have a length and can be accessed by index**, but they are **NOT** arrays. To iterate through them, you have to use a traditional for loop:


const allLis = document.querySelectorAll('li');

for (let i = 0; i < allLis.length; i++) {
	console.log(allLis[i]);
	allLis[i].innerText = 'hellllllllllooooooo';
};

**Once inside the for loop, you can read and write these elements, with methods we've already learned.,**


**Example 2:**
	for (let li of allLis) {
		li.innerHTML = 'WE ARE <b>THE CHAMPIONS</b>!!!!!'
	}
		
		**this changes the HTML and the text so that now, the text will be bolded.**
