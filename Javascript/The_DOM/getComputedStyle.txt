====== getComputedStyle ======
Created Sunday 18 April 2021

getComputedStyle is used to get the information from the CSS stylesheet regarding the item in question.

**Example:**
	const li = document.querySelector('li');
	
	const styles = getComputedStyle(li)
		- returns a large list of the styles applied to the selected <li>, most of which are default styles that the browser applies.
		
		**NOTE:** These are the **currently computed** styles, meaning that if you add something like **h1:hover**, etc., the values will change to reflect the **current  conditions** if you are hovering over the element at the moment.
