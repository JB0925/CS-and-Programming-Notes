====== Load Events ======
Created Sunday 23 May 2021

Whenever the browser encounters a script, it runs it right away. This is why it's a good idea to put most script tags at the bottom of the body. Some exceptions might be libraries such as Axios, etc.

**A Way Around This:**
	If you really want to put your script at the top of your HTML file, you can run an addEventListener for "DomContentLoaded 
	
	- **document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {**
		**// your code goes here**
	**});**
	
	All of the code inside an event listener with '**DOMContentLoaded** will only run once the DOM is loaded.
	
	'DOMContentLoaded is only waiting for the HTML document to be loaded and parsed.
	
	**It does not wait for everything on the page to be fully loaded.**
	


**Wait For Everything on the Page to be Fully Loaded:**
	- **window.addEventListener('load', function() {**
		// your code goes here
	**});**
	
	
	**This code will not run until everything in the DOM is fully loaded.**
	


1). Use **'DOMContentLoaded** if you want to wait for the page to load, but don't necessarily care that everything on the page has loaded.

2). Use **window.addEventListen('load', function() {}); **if you really need everything on the page to be fully loaded.

**NOTE: **Option 2 can lead to bad User Experience at times, if the user has to wait a couple seconds before anything happens.
