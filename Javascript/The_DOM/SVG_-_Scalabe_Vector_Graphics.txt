====== SVG - Scalabe Vector Graphics ======
Created Monday 26 April 2021

SVG's are HTML elements that can be manipulated using Javascript.

**Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/SVG Example.png}}

This draws a black circle on the screen. The height and width are the size of the box drawn around the circle.


SVG's have an X and Y axis. The movement along the axes' starts in the **top left corner**.

X moves from left to right.
Y moves from top to bottom.

**Anything that we want to show up must fit within the "width" and "height" attributes of the SVG itself.**

Changing the **CX** value will shift the circle to the right. 
Changing the **CY **value will shift the circle to the bottom of the SVG.
Changing the **r** value will make the circle significantly larger.

You can show more than one shape inside of an SVG if you want to.
