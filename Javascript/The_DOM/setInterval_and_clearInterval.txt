====== setInterval and clearInterval ======
Created Wednesday 28 April 2021

Both **setInterval** and **clearInterval** are used to make something happen in the browser at intervallic time periods. 

**setInterval** takes a function first, then an amount of time **measured in milliseconds (1 second = 1,000 milliseconds).**

**clearInterval** only takes an object that already has had **setInterval** called on it,

**Example:**

Here, I created an interval object called **this.interval** with **setInterval**, and passed it the **this.tick** function name (**DONT CALL IT**) and **20, or 20 milliseconds**. **this.tick** counts down the timer (**the duration input value**) until it gets to 0, then it calls **this.pause**.

**this.pause()** is used to clear the interval, simply by passing the interval object in.

These functions, **start() **and **pause()**, are then added to event listeners for the Play and Pause buttons:
