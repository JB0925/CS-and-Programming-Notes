====== setTimeout and clearTimeout ======
Created Thursday 29 April 2021

How to use **setTimeout** and **clearTimeout** to create a timer of sorts:

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/setTimeout and clearTimeout.png}}

In the above code, we select our input element, and we declare a variable, **timeoutId**, as a way to turn **setTimeout** into a timer of sorts.

**NOTE: Every time a setTimeout object is called, it returns an ID. Call it once, it will return 1. Call it again, it will return 2, etc.**

We create an **event** that runs a check to see if there is a **timeoutId**. REMEMBER, **timeoutId** is returned every time the **setTimeout **object is called. 

The first time this function is called, the API will get queried because there is no **timeoutId**. **setTimeout** hasn't been called yet. After that, **every time the user types, the "setTimeout" object will be called, only to be cleared as the user types another key.**

So, if the user types another key before one second has passed, the **setTimeout **object is cleared. **ONLY after 1 second and no more typing, will the "setTimeout" object execute.**

This cuts down greatly on API calls.

Finally, we add an event listener on the input, and call the **onInput** function within it.

**This process is called "Debouncing an Input".**
