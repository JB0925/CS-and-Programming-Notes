====== innerText and textContent ======
Created Saturday 17 April 2021

Once you have selected an element, i.e. **document.querySelector('#myIdHere')**, you can then use **.innerText** or **.textContent** to get the text that is printed on the screen.


The main difference is that **textContent** will return all text, including hidden text, properly formatted, and **innerText **will not.
