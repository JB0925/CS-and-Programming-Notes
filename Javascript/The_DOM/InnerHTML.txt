====== InnerHTML ======
Created Saturday 17 April 2021

Inner HTML is similar to 'innerText and textContent in that it will get all of the text between HTML tags, but it will **also get all of the tags and attributes as well.**

innerHTML can also be used to insert new HTML into a document.

**Example:**
	let h1 = document.querySelector('h1')
	**h1.innerHTML**
		- returns all of the tags, attributes, and text from the selected h1 tag
	
	**h1.innerHTML = '<h1 class="my_new_class">Hi and hello!!!!!</h1>**
		- sets the text and html for that tag to whatever is passed in.
