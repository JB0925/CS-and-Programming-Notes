====== Chaining THEN calls ======
Created Wednesday 21 April 2021

A better, cleaner way to chain **then** and **catch** calls for Promises is in the picture below. It works because:

1). the value being **returned** in the **then** clause **is a Promise itself.**
	- it won't work if the return value of the **then** clause is not a Promise
	- remember, it's easy to wrap a Promise in a function

2). There is ONE **catch** call that serves for ALL of the potential **then** calls.
