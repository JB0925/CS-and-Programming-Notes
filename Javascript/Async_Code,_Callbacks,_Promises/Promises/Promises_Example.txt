====== Promises Example ======
Created Wednesday 21 April 2021

Here is a larger example of a Promise in action:
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/JS Promise Example.png}}

Here we are creating a new function called **moveTheButton**, and passing it one parameter, **code**.

The **moveTheButton** function is **returning a Promise**.

The Promise uses **setTimeout**, which also takes a function.

Inside of **setTimeout**, I created a Status Codes object. 

Then, the meat of the function says that **if the code passed in IS in the Status Codes object, **then return the **resolve** function **WITH the status for the code that is passed in.**

**If the code is NOT in the object**, return the reject function with the message **"not in codes object!"**


**EXECUTING THE FUNCTION:**

In the example, I've called moveTheButton with an argument of **2**.

I then chain the **then **and **catch** methods to it, **MAKING SURE TO PASS IN the values from RESOLVE and REJECT in the function.**

I then write a small function to **console.log** what the **resolve **and **reject** functions return.

**However, there is a better way to call / execute the function! SEE THE NEXT PAGE FOR AN EXAMPLE!**
