====== Promise.race ======
Created Friday 03 September 2021

**Promise.race** also accepts an array of promises and returns a new Promise

Unlike **Promise.all**, the new Promise will resolve or reject as soon as one Promise in the array resolves or rejects (like a race, aka which one will "win"?)

The syntax will work essentially the same way as **Promise.all**, except for the fact that **Promise.race** will return one Promise instead of one array of several promises.
