====== Promise.all ======
Created Friday 03 September 2021

**Promise.all** accepts an array of Promises, and returns **one new** Promise.

The new Promise will resolve when every Promise in the array resolves, and will be rejected if any Promise in the array is rejected.

It is typically used as a way to run some code after another block of code has completed.

**Promise.all** is very useful when you want to send out several **independent** requests **in parallel.**



**Example:**
	let promisesArray = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		promisesArray.push(
			axios.get('myUrl')
		)
	}
	
	**Promise.all(promisesArray)**
	.then(arr => (
		arr.forEach(p => console.log(p.name))
	))
	.catch(err => console.log(err));
	

**NOTE: **It is important to remember that **Promises.all** returns the new Promise in an array, which is why we are calling **forEach** on it.
