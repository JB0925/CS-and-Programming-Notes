====== The Call Stack ======
Created Tuesday 20 April 2021

The call stack is the mechanism that the JS interpreter uses to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.

How JS "knows" what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.


**How it Works:**
	- when a script calls a function, that function is added to the top of the call stack
	- any functions that are called by that function are placed on top of it, and are run before the "main" function
	- when the interpreter is finished, it takes the function off the stack, and it resumes execution based on where it left off
	


**How to See the Call Stack in Chrome Dev Tools:**
	- in Dev Tools, go to Sources
	- open your code in the Sources tab and click on the line number of the function you want to add a breakpoint to.
