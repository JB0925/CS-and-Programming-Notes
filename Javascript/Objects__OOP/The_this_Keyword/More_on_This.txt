**When using "This", it refers to whatever is to the left of the dot.**

If there is nothing to the left of the dot, then it refers to the window object.


**Example:**
	let cat = {
		name: 'Harvey',
		meow: function() {
			return `${**this.name**} says meow!`
		}
	};
	
	**This example will refer to the cat object:**
		cat.meow();
			**returns "Harvey says meow!"**
	
	**This example will not work:**
		let catMeow = cat.meow
		catMeow();
			**returns "   says meow!"**

	
	In the first example, to the left of the dot, is the cat object. The **this **refers to the cat object.
	
	In the second example, there is nothing to the left of the dot, so it refers to the window. In most other examples, it would return **undefined says meow!, **but the window does have a name property that is usually an empty string.
