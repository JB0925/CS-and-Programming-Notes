====== Manipulating Complex Objects ======
Created Friday 19 March 2021

Just like in Python, you can have complex objects. 

For example, a variable could be a list of objects in brackets.



**You access these object values the same way you do a JSON object (because that's what it is, essentially).**

**Example:**
	var myPlants = [
	{
		   "type": "flowers",
		 "list": [
		   "rose",
		   "tulip",
		   "dandelion"
		]
	},
	{
		 "type": "trees",
		 "list" : [
				 "fir",
				 "pine",
				 "birch"
			 ]
		}
	   ];


**So, if you wanted to get the second tree from the "trees" section, you'd do the following:**
	var myTree = myPlants[1].list[1];
	console.log(myTree)
		returns "pine"
