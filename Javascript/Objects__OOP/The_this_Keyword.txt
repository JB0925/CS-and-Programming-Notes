====== The this Keyword ======
Created Thursday 15 April 2021

In the global scope, the **this** keyword refers to the global scope. or the **window**.

**NOTE: let** and **const** are not added to the global scope.

So, in a normal function outside of an object, the **this** keyword is always attached to the window, which has all of the globally available functions and methods attached to it.


"**this**" becomes especially useful with object methods.
