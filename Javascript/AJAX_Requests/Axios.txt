====== Axios ======
Created Thursday 22 April 2021

Axios is not a built in library, to use it you have to include a script tag at the bottom of the body with an external link.

Axios works in the browser, and with server side things like Node.js

**Script link to place at bottom of body:**
	`<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>`



**With Axios, you don't need to parse the JSON you receive, like you have to do with Fetch. It's done for you.**

The above takes care of all of the parsing for you.

**Adding a catch like below will then A). do the parsing, and B). automatically check the status code so that you don't have to do a manual check.**
