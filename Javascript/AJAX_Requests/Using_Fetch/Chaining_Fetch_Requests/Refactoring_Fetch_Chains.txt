====== Refactoring Fetch Chains ======
Created Thursday 22 April 2021

**Starting Fetch Chains:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Refactoring Fetch Starter Code.png}}


**Refactoring The Code Above:**

To refactor the code, I've divided it up into four separate functions to go through one by one, and then the entire thing at the end.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Check Status and Parse.png}}

**checkStatusAndParse** checks to see if the request status is ok, and throws an error if not. If it is ok, it returns a parsed JSON response.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/printPlanets Fetch.png}}

**printPlanets** just prints each planet name, and then returns a Promise with the same data, to pass off to the next function.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/fetchPlanets Fetch Refactoring.png}}

**fetchPlanets** makes another request, this time with a new url returned from the previous Fetch call.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/catchErrors Fetch Refactoring.png}}

**catchErrors **just catches any errors from the other lines in the chain and prints them to the console.



**Putting It All Together:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Refactored Fetch Chain.png}}

**Summary:**
	1). Fetch the URL
	2). Check the status and parse it to JSON if the status is ok/200
	3). Print each planet name and return a Promise.resolve(data).
	4). Fetch more planet data (page 2 of the data)
	5). Repeat step 2.
	6). Repeat step 3.
	7). Catch any errors.
	
	**Much cleaner than the above!**
