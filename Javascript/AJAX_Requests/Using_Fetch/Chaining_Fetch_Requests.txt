====== Chaining Fetch Requests ======
Created Wednesday 21 April 2021

Step 1 - Check to see if the response is ok. If not, throw the error. If it is,  **return** response.json().

Step 2: un-nest the second **then** method

**Making Multiple Requests:**
	You can make multiple requests because what is being returned via Fetch is a Promise. So, if you make a request and that returns you another endpoint, you can chain it with **then**. **Here's an example:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Fetch Chaining 2.png}}


Here, we make an initial request with Fetch, and we return a JSON response. 

From there, it points to another endpoint, so we run another fetch request on that and return the Promise.

From that Promise, we return the JSON data for the SECOND endpoint.

Then finally, we print that data out.
