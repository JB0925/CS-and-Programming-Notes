====== Using Fetch ======
Created Wednesday 21 April 2021

Fetch is the newer way of making requests.

Fetch supports Promises.

Fetch is NOT supported in Internet Explorer.



**Fetch Example:**

1). Since **fetch** returns a Promise, we use our **then** and **catch** methods.

2)., The **then **method takes a response, and the **catch** method takes an error.

3). Inside of the **then**, we check to see if the **response code** is ok, If it's not, then we **throw an error**.

4). If the **response code is ok**, then we call **.json().then() **on it.

5). **.then **takes an argument that is the data from the response. Here, we check the name of the returned object, and loop over it to print the names of the planets.

6). Finally, we catch the error if something did not work. **Step 3 and Step 6 (this step)** are linked.
