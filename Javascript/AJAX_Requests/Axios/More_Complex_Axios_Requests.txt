====== More Complex Axios Requests ======
Created Thursday 22 April 2021

Here is an example of chaining Axios requests, much like we did with Fetch and XMLHttpResponse.

**Refactoring the Above Code:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Axios-fetchPlanets.png}}

**fetchPlanets** is used to return a Promise from the url passed into it. The default is the swapi site if nothing else is passed in.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Axios-printPlanets.png}}

**printPlanets** literally just prints the planets and returns a resolved Promise with the data's next link. The Promise is necessary to keep the **.then / .catch** chain going.

**catchErrors** is just a catch function to catch any errors that Axios throws at us.




**Putting It All Together:**

Nice and tidy code that 

1). gets the data from the link
2). Prints the data and returns the data
3). Gets and returns data from another link
4). Prints that data and returns a Promise
6). Catches any errors that may occur.
