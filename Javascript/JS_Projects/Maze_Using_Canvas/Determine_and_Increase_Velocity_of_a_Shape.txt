====== Determine and Increase Velocity of a Shape ======
Created Sunday 16 May 2021

First, destructure another object out of Matter.js:

**const {Engine, Render, Runner, World, Bodies, Body} = Matter;**

**Disable Gravity on Engine (not required):**
	- You will have a lot of boilerplate code required to initialize the Matter.js "world".
	- once **engine** is created with **const engine = Engine.create();**, add the following below it:
	- **engine.world.gravity.y = 0;**


The one we need to get/manipulate the velocity is **Body.**

Use **Body.setVelocity();** to change the velocity of the shape.

**Syntax:**
	- **Body.setVelocity(<shape>, {x:x, y: y - 5})**


From here, create a **document** addEventListener, and listen for **keydown** events.

Select the keys that you want to be **up, down, left, and right**, and get their **key** value, or the **keyCode** value.


**Inside the document.addEventListener()**, add:
	- **const {x, y} = <shape>.velocity;**
	
	Then, just call **Body.setVelocity(<shape>, {x:x, y:y}) **as needed.
	
	**NOTE:** You will have to manipulate the x and y values in order to get the shape to move. See the sample below.

First statement: moves the shape **up.**
Second statement: moves the shape **down.**
Third statement: moves the shape **left.**
Fourth statement: moves the shape **right.**
