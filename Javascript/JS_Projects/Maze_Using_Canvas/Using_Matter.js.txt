====== Using Matter.js ======
Created Monday 03 May 2021

To include **matter.js** in a project, use the following script tag:
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/matter-js/0.17.1/matter.min.js" integrity="sha512-3CP+e7z5ieYYTIyvRvV3eGVYR67yXg5V2mWfg8pEJJd2mlh8tG/cnDv5scTmRztEYHTksBlpPOmxFOiMtHfZdQ==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


**Matter JS Terminology:**
	**World: **an object that contains all of the things or shapes in our matter app. **The World is the dark canvas.**
	
	**Engine: **Reads in the current state of the world from the world object, then calculates changes in positions of all the various shapes
	
	**Runner: **Gets the engine and world to work together. Runs about 60 times per second.
	
	**Render: **Whenever the engine processes an update, Render looks at the shapes and shows them on-screen
	
	**Body: **A shape that we are displaying. Can be a circle, rectangle, oval, etc.


**When you use Matter and you pass in a "height" and "width" into the Render.create() call, you are creating an HTML element called a "canvas". If you inspect the HTML, you will see "canvas" instead of div, etc.**
