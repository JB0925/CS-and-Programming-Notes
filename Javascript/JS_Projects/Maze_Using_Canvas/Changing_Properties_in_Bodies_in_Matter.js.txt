====== Changing Properties in Bodies in Matter.js ======
Created Sunday 16 May 2021

One thing to note, is that it's a really good idea to give your Bodies objects labels if you plan to manipulate them later.

Here, we add the **"wall"** label to our horizontal and vertical walls.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Labels for Walls - Matter.js.png}}

You can see the **label: "wall"** in each array's **options** object.


From there, we manipulate the world itself.

Remember, earlier, we changed **engine.world.gravity.y = 0**

Now, we change it back to 1:
	**world.gravity.y = 1;**

**world.bodies** is an array, so we call **forEach** on it and manipulate the **setStatic() property** of each item in the array:

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Change Static Property in world.bodies - Matter.js.png}}

We use the **Body** object to update the **setStatic** property.
