====== Detecting Collisions in Matter.js ======
Created Sunday 16 May 2021

const {Engine, Render, Runner, World, Bodies, Body, **Events**} = Matter;


To detect when one shape runs into another in Matter.js, we need to add the **Events** object to our deconstructed Matter object.

Then, we need to give labels to the object that we want to detect the collision with. We will give a label to our **ball** and our **goal.**

Above, we've added a method from the **Events** class, called **on**. 

When we console.log(event), we see there is an array called **pairs** inside of it. Pairs "self destructs" after evey collision, but we can access it with **event.pairs**.

From there, we call **forEach** on the **event.pairs** array.
When there is a collision, the **collision object** has a **bodyA** and a **bodyB** attribute. 

So then, we just check if **bodyA** or **bodyB** have the label of **'goal'** that we gave to our goal object above. If it is, we console.log() "**you won!!!"**
