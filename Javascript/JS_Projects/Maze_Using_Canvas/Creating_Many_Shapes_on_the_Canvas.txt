====== Creating Many Shapes on the Canvas ======
Created Monday 03 May 2021

**NOTE: **Adding **wireframes: false** to the Render class instance will make it so that shapes are filled in with random colors.

To see more options for shapes, go to the Matter.js docs and look for Bodies.

Three main types of shapes:
	1). Rectangle (takes X and Y coords, and a height and width)
	2). Circle (takes X and Y coords and a radius)
	3). Polygons (varying sides, takes X and Y coords, number of sides, and a radius)
	
We already know how to create a shape and add it to the world, now let's look at this function for how to add many shapes at once:

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Add Many Shapes - Matter.js.png}}

Here, I've created a shape array generator. I set **sides = null **and **radius = null**, because a rectangle doesn't take those arguments.

To use this function, you must pass in a shapeName. From here, we check the shapename and call the appropriate **Bodies.shapeName()** method, adding in the X and Y coordinates, as well as the number of sides and radius, if applicable. Finally, return the array.

**NOTE: **Each call to **Bodies.shapeName()** can take an optional **options** object. We can use this to set the color of our shapes with **fillStyle: 'color'** if we want. 

Here, I've used the **fillStyle** option to set all rectangles to be green. **You can also pass in RGB, Hex, etc., values instead of a string name.**

Finally, we call world.add on each call to the shapecreator function.
