====== Create a Controller ======
Created Saturday 19 February 2022

To create a controller, you need to find your package name in the **src** file. It is the one that says **com.package...**

Control + click the package name and add a new package

You add a new package by typing:
	**com.company.my-package-name.<myController>**
	
This will create a new directory inside of the Main package.
