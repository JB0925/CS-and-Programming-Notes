====== Adding Logging ======
Created Monday 21 February 2022

Spring Boot comes with a built in logger. To use it, inside of the Controller, type the following:

**Instantiating the Logger:**

private final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DepartmentController.class);



**Using the Logger:**

Inside of your restful routes, right above the call to the service layer, you can write:
	**LOGGER.info("Whatever you want here.");**
