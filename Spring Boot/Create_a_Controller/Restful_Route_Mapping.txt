====== Restful Route Mapping ======
Created Saturday 19 February 2022

Spring Boot has several RESTful route mappings, and all of the major ones:
	@GetMapping
	@PostMapping
	@DeleteMapping
	@PutMapping
	@PatchMapping 


These are all used as decorators over top of class methods inside of a controller.
