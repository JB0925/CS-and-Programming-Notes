====== Annotations ======
Created Sunday 20 February 2022

Annotations are the decorators that are placed over top of classes, variables, etc.

**@Autowired - **you place this above the name of a class to let Spring instantiate for you at runtime. Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control.

**@PathVariable("nameOfVar") Type varName - **placed inside of a RESTful route's namespace, it transforms a route parameter into the type of variable that comes after the annotation

**@RequestBody - **when placed inside of a RESTful route's name space, it transforms the incoming request body (POST / PUT request) into a particular object:

**Example:**
	public Department saveDepartment(@RequestBody Department department) {}
	
	**// the request body gets transformed into a Department object**
	


@GetMapping , @PostMapping, etc. - each one will take a route endpoint in the form of **("/departments")**, and denotes whether the route is a GET request, POST request, etc. Each one goes right above a class method inside of a class that has the @RestController decorator


@RestController - denotes that this is a group of RESTful API routes.
