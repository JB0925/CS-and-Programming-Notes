====== Validation with Hibernate ======
Created Monday 21 February 2022

1). Go to start.spring.io, click Add Dependencies, and search for "validate". Choose it, and click "Explore"

2). Search for the dependency with "spring-boot-starter-validation", copy it, and add it to your pom.xml

3). In your Entity (db table representation), above the **class fields**, you can add validations:
	**Example:**
		@NotBlank(message = "Please fill in field")
		private String departmentName;
	
	**NOTE: **You can add more than one.
	

4). In your Controllers, any time that you accept data from the request body, you have to add the Valid annotation before it:
	**public void createNewDepartment(@Valid @RequestBody Department department) {**
		// do stuff
	}
