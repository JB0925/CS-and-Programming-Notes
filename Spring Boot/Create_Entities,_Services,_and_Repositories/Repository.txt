====== Repository ======
Created Sunday 20 February 2022

Repository deals with database interactions.

For this, it does not need its own entity; you just need an interface.

Here, we are using the JpaRepository and passing it our entity **Department**, and the data type of its primary key, which is **Long**.

**Example:**
	**NOTE:** The reference to Long below is becuase the primary key of the table is of data type Long.

**NOTE:** If you only want to use the standard queries, you can leave the Repository methodless.

If you want to use a **custom SELECT query**, you MUST use **findBy **as the beginning of the method name.

public Interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
	**// custom query**
	public Department findByDepartmentName(String departmentName);
	
	**// Same as SELECT * FROM departments**
						**WHERE name = departmentName**
}
