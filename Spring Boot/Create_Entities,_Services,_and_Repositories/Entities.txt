====== Entities ======
Created Saturday 19 February 2022

**Entities are typically a representation of a single table in a database.**

Below is an example Entity:

**NOTES:**
	1). The Class needs to be decorated with **@Entity**
	
	2). We need to choose a primary key for our DB, so we use the @Id decorator for that.
	
	3). We also decorate it with @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) to make the primary key auto-increment
	
	**NEXT STEPS:** Create a **controller** for this entity. Also, create an Interface for this class in the Service folder.
