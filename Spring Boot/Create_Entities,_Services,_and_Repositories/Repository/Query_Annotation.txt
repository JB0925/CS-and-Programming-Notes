====== Query Annotation ======
Created Monday 21 February 2022

To pass a more complex query than what you can find on the Spring Jpa Docs, you can use the Query annotation:

**Example:**

@Query("select * FROM cars JOIN cars_owners ON cars.owner_id = cars_owners.owner_id JOIN owners ON owners.id = cars_owners.owner_id WHERE cars.owner_id = ?1)
**public Car findByOwnerId(Long ownerId);**
