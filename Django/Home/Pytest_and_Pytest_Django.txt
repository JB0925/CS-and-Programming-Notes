====== Pytest and Pytest Django ======
Created Saturday 06 March 2021

**LOOK INTO PYTEST XDIST...PYTEST >= 6.0.0**

**Things that need to be done to use pytest with django inside a poetry environment:**
	- poetry add pytest, pytest-django
	- add a pytest.ini file
		Contents:
			{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	- create your tests in the **tests** directory for the project
	- run your tests with **pytest**
		- you can run an individual test with **pytest 'path/to/file.py**
		- you can use **-vv** to get more information on each test that fails



**My Tests:**
	- check the Musical_Instrument_Crawler/crawler folder, under **tests**


**Helpful Django Pytest Docs:**
	- https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/helpers.html


**Things to Remember:**
	Create a Logged In User:
		- {{.\pasted_image001.png}}
		- you can use this logged in user to test for things that should happen when a user is logged in
		- don't login the user when you want to test things that should happen when a user is logged out


	**Render_to_string:**
		- helpful method for rendering html content to a string, then checking to see if something is in it
		{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
	
	
	**Make Multiple Assertions:**
		{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
		
	
	**Test Logged Out, Then Logged In:**
		{{.\pasted_image004.png}}
		
		- first, we take a logged out user and check to see if they are (appropriately) redirected.
		- then, we log the user in and check to see if a certain string is in the response content
		**NOTE: Use "follow=True" to have the url follow until its final destination (i.e. if it will redirect, then go to the correct link)**
