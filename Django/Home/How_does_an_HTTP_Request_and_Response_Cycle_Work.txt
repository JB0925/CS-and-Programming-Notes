====== How does an HTTP Request and Response Cycle Work ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

When you type in a URL in Django:
	- the first thing that happens is a **URLpattern** is found that matches our homepage
	- the **URLpattern** specifies a **view**, which then determines the content for the page, and then finally a **template** for styling and basic logic
	- the end result is sent back to the user in the form of an **HTTP response**
	
	**Example Flow Chart:**
		- {{.\pasted_image001.png}}
		
		- sometimes, a **Model** is not needed
	
	
	**The Takeaway:**
		- Django **views** determine **what** is displayed on a page
		- **URLConfs** determine **where **that information is going
		- the **model** contains the **content** from the **database**
		- the **template** provides **styling **for it
