====== Querysets-Django db Model Queriess ======
Created Thursday 18 February 2021

open the Django interactive shell with **python manage.py shell**

presumably, you have a **models.py** file created inside your **app**

**from pages.models import 'ModelName**


'**ModelName.objects.all()**
	- returns a list of all 'ModelName objects that have been created


**from django.contrib.auth.models import User**

**User.objects.all()**
	- returns a list of all User objects (at this point, only the **superuser**)



**Create a new 'ModelName Object:**
	**me = User.objects.get(username='jesse')**
	**Post.objects.create(author=me, title='sample', text='Test')**
	
	To double check that everything worked, call '**ModelName.objects.all()** again
		- 

**Query the ORM:**
	- **'ModelName.objects.filter(author=me)**
		- returns a Queryset of all objects where the author is 'me'
	
	- **'ModelName.objects.filter(title__contains='some string')**
		- returns a Queryset of all objects that contain 'some string'
	
	- **'ModelName.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now())**
		- **__lte** means 'less than or equal to'
		- returns a list of objects that were published with a time less than or equal to now
		
	- **post = 'ModelName.objects.get(title='some title')**
		- gets a post from the ORM with the title 'some title' and stores it in a variable called 'post'


**Ordering Objects:**
	- **'ModelName.objects.order_by('created_date')**
		- returns a Queryset where the posts are ordered by the date they were created
		- adding - to 'created_date'  ('**-created_date**') orders them in reverse order


**Method Chaining:**
	- '**ModelName.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now()).order_by('published_date')**
		- returns a Queryset where the posts were published in the past AND then ordered by their published date
