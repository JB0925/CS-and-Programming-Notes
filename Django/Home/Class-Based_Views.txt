====== Class-Based Views ======
Created Monday 01 February 2020

You can use **class-based views** to display your templates, instead of having to rewrite new functions that repeat certain things over and over again.

To do this:
	- go to the **views.py** file in the **project's **main directory:
			- **code pages/views.py**
	
	- Use '**TemplateView **to display your template:
		- **def 'HomePageView(TemplateView'):**
			**template_name='home.html'**
