====== Exclude and order by methods ======
Created Wednesday 03 March 2021

**Exclude:**
You can exclude results from your 'QuerySet by using the **exclude** method.

**Example:**
	**User.objects.filter(username__startswith='J').exclude(username__endswith='e')**
		- will return all User objects whose username attribute begins with J, but exclude all whose username attribute end with e.
		{{.\pasted_image.png}}
		- I was the only one in the DB. My name starts with j, but also ends with e, hence the empty queryset.
		**Without the exclude clause:**
			{{.\pasted_image001.png}}




**Order By:**
	- basic sorting of objects
	- default is ascending; can get descending with "-"

	The ordering is thrown off by the four digit number, but the idea is correct.
