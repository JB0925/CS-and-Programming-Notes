====== Create a .env File for Environment Variables ======
Created Thursday 25 February 2021

Step 1). poetry add **python-decouple** and **dj-database-url**

Step 2). Create a **.env** file (just .env; no name) and take out of **settings.py **the **values **of variables that you wish to keep secret such as DEBUG, SECRET_KEY, and DATABASE_URL. Put those values into the **.env** file

**SEE BOTTOM FOR INFO ON HOW TO MIGRATE TO POSTGRES**

Step 3). In **settings.py** add the relevant information.


**How the .env File Should Look:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}  **NOTE:** Don't really need ENGINE or NAME.


**How settings.py Should Look:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
{{.\pasted_image004.png}}

You can see how the values from the **.env** file populate the fields in **settings.py**


**.env.example File:**
	- You should NEVER commit your **.env** file to version contol. Add it to **.gitignore** right away.
	- It is good practice to add a **.env.example** file, however
	- Here's what that looks like, given the information above:
	{{.\pasted_image005.png}}
	
	**Very simple, only used to show what values should go in the places you removed the values from.**


**How to Migrate to Postgres:**
	- get set up as a user in postgres (see Postgres notebook if necessary)
	- make sure your account is the current user in Postgres and create a new database **CREATE DATABASE db_name;**
	- in your **.env** file, add your Postgres connection string in the following format:
		DATABASE_URL=postgres://jesse:MusicMaster@0.0.0.0:5432/searchresults
	
	**Format= db_type://postgres_username:postgres_password@localhost(0.0.0.0):port_number/db_name**
