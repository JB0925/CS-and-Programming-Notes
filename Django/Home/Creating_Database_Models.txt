====== Creating Database Models ======
Created Tuesday 02 February 2021

1). Go to **app_name / models.py** and create a class:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}


2). Activate the model(s).
	- create a **migrations** file with the **python manage.py makemigrations app_name**
		- a **migrations** file tracks changes over time, which is useful in debugging
	- build the database with the **python manage.py migrate app_name** command

3). Register the model(s):
	- go to **app_name_directory/admin.py** and add the following:
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
	

**Some Model Fields:**

**models.CharField** – this is how you define text with a limited number of characters.
**models.TextField** – this is for long text without a limit. Sounds ideal for blog post content, right?
**models.DateTimeField** – this is a date and time.
**models.ForeignKey** – this is a link to another model.
	

**Larger Model Example:**
