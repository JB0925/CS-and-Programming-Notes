1). Create a new app on Heroku
	- from the command line, run **heroku create**
	- it will give your app a random name that you can change later

2). disable the collection of static files 
	- from the command line, run:	{{.\pasted_image.png}}

3). push the code up to Heroku
	- from the command line, run **git push heroku master**

4). start the Heroku server so the app is live
	- from the command line, run **heroku 'ps:scale web=1**

5). visit the app on Heroku's provided URL
