====== The bulk create method ======
Created Saturday 27 February 2021

Use bulk_create to store a list of objects into a database at once.

**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Here I am saying that if there is a list of search results, call the **bulk_create** method on each item in, in this case, each namedtuple, over the whole list of objects.
