====== Adding Templates ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

**Getting Started:**
	- in the main directory of the project, and inside the virtual environment:
		- **mkdir templates**
		- **touch templates/template_name.html**


	- go back to **config/settings.py** and update the **TEMPLATES** list
	- in the dict under **DIRS**, enter:
		{{.\pasted_image.png}}
		- **this allows you to not have to create a new templates folder, then a subfolder with the same name as the app, then a some_name.html file inside of that, for EVERY app you create**
		- instead, we made this subtle change to the **project's** "**config/settings.py"** file
		
	- from there, you can code the **templates/home.html** file however you'd like
