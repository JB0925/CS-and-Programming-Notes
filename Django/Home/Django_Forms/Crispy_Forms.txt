====== Crispy Forms ======
Created Thursday 25 February 2021

Step 1). In your venv, install **django-crispy-forms**

Step 2). In **settings.py**, add '**crispy_forms',   **in **INSTALLED_APPS**, and add **CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'** at the end of the same file.

Step 3). Put the required Bootstrap CDN and JS links in the **base.html** page. Make sure it is for the version of Bootstrap that you are using.

Step 4). After your forms are made in **forms.py**, when you go to render them on another page, use:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Step 5). The HTML template for a basic crispy form:
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

The above is all it takes to render a nice looking form with Crispy Forms. The button at the bottom takes a basic Bootstrap button class.


**If you want your form to use different classes, find out what those classes are and do something like this:**
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
