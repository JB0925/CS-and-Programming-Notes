====== Form Instances - How to access only User data ======
Created Tuesday 23 March 2021

When passing in data from a form, if you need to access a specifc User's data and ONLY that User, you can pass an instance to the form instance created on request.POST:

**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}


This will ensure that you are only accessing that user's instance of a specific database field, and won't update all other user's records. Of course, this particular table is tied to a user by a foreign key as well.
