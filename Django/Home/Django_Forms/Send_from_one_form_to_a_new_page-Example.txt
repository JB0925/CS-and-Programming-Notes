====== Send from one form to a new page-Example ======
Created Saturday 20 February 2021

**Imports:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**search.models** could just be **.models**
Here we are importing the **db models**, **render** to render the template
We DO NOT need line 2 or line 5

**First Page:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
Two options: If the request is a POST, then we establish a form and, if that form is valid, we redirect to another page
					- otherwise, we establish a form, then put that into a "context" variable, and render the first page.


**View Page:**
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
This page is the inverse of the first page. If the method is GET, then we just render the view page template.

If not, then we collect all of the form data and save it into a model object. Save the model object.
Finally, choose one of the data points, and pass it into the render template request.
