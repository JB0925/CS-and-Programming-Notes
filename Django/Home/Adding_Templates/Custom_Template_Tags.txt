====== Custom Template Tags ======
Created Sunday 21 March 2021

Custom template tags are like helper functions that allow you to do something to a piece of data that is passed into the template.

Inside of your app, create a directory called **templatetags**. Inside of that, create an "**__init__.py" **file that is empty, and then create a **tags.py** file where the helper functions live.

**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}


{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**In tags.py:**
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
  You can add however many custom template tags that you need. The **item** variable is the piece of data that the function will alter.


**In the template itself:**
	{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
	
	{{.\pasted_image004.png}}

	[[Home:URLPattern]]**Syntax:** double brackets, data/information to act on, pipe, function name from **tags.py**, closed brackets.
