====== Template URL Links ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

Similar to **Flask**, **Django** has **template tags** that look like this:		**{% template tag here %}**

To add URLs to our templates, we can use **{% url 'home' %}	**or** 	{% url 'about' %}**

Either of these work because we added the **class-based views** to the **views** page

**Example:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	And here is the 'home.html' template:
		{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
		
	**NOTE: **Look at the block content / endblock content in the first picture. There is nothing between it, because it is to be filled by what goes on the pages that inherit from it (**see the second picture inside of the block content / endblock content tags**)
