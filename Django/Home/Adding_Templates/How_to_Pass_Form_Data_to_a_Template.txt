Created Thursday 25 February 2021

**Some Basic Logic For Passing Form Data from Page to Page:**

Using the **'@login_required** decorator here means that if a User tries to go here without being logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

**Send From:**
	**Basic Idea:**
		- create an instance of the form
			- if it's a POST request, pass the POST request data to our form and, if it's valid data, save it. 
			- redirect to the Display page
			
			- if it's NOT a POST request, pass the bank form into a **render** call to render the page's HTML.

**Send To:**
	**Basic Idea:**
		- if it's a GET request, just render the basic html of the page
		
		- if it's a POST request, pull the data out from the form (**notice the special handling of the 'BooleanField**), create a model object, save it, and render the display_page template, this time with the info passed in as context.
