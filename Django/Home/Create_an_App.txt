====== Create an App ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

Django distinguishes between **projects** and **apps**. This is why, when you run **django-admin startproject config .**, you are starting a new **project.**

**The project is the overall application, and apps are similar to pages inside the project.**

Another way to look at it, is that **apps** are like functions inside of a regular Python script



**To Start an App:**
	- **python manage.py startapp app_name_here**
	
	
When the above command is run, and then you run the **tree** command, you get a folder of your app name, and several files inside of it:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}				{{.\pasted_image001.png}}


**NOTE: Even though our app exists, Django doesn't know about it until we explicitly add it.**
	- type **vi config/settings.py** 
	- find the **INSTALLED APPS** list and add your new app name to it:
		{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
