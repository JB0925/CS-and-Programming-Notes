====== URLPattern ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

{{.\pasted_image.png}}


On the first line, we imported **path** to power our **URLPattern**
On the next line, we imported our **views** from the **views.py** file, and specifically imported the **homePageView** function that we created



Our **URLPattern "path"** object has three parts:
	- a reference to the Regex ' '
	- a reference to our **view** called **homePageView**
	- an optional named **URLPattern** called '**home'**
	
	**This means that if the user calls the homepage represented by the empty string ' ', Django should use the view called homePageView.**
