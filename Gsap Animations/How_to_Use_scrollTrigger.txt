====== How to Use scrollTrigger ======
Created Sunday 02 January 2022

ScrollTrigger is a tool that makes your animations wait until the user has scrolled into view.

Once you have installed gsap you have access to the **scrollTrigger** function. 

**How to Import It:**
	import { gsap, Bounce } from "gsap";
	import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/dist/ScrollTrigger";
	
**Before you go to use it:**
	gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
	

gsap.fromTo(pic2Ref.current, { y: -window.innerHeight, visibility: "hidden" }, { y: 0, visibility: "visible", duration: 1, **scrollTrigger: ".photos"**}, "<20%");


In the above, we use scrollTrigger to say "make this animation wait until the element with the class name "photos" comes into view.
