====== The FromTo Method ======
Created Friday 31 December 2021

**FromTo** allows you to move an object from a space, to another space.

It takes three params:
	1). An element i.e. ".text", or ref.current
	
	2). An object to tell where to go **from**
	
	3). An object to tell where to go **to**
	

**Examples:**
	
	**// fades in**
	gsap.fromTo(".text", {opacity: 0}, {opacity: 1});
	
	**// fades in and moves from down 20px to its normal position**
	gsap.fromTo(".text", {opacity: 0, y:20}, {opacity: 1, y: 0});

	  gsap.fromTo(pic1Ref.current, { y: 500 }, { y: 0, duration: 1, scrollTrigger: ".photos"});

	gsap.fromTo(pic2Ref.current, { y: -window.innerHeight, visibility: "hidden" }, { y: 0, visibility: "visible", duration: 1, scrollTrigger: ".photos"}, "<20%");
	
	gsap.fromTo(pic3Ref.current, { x: 500 }, { x: 0, ease: Bounce.easeOut, duration: 2, scrollTrigger: ".photos"}, "<10%");
	
	
	
**Last Three Examples:**
	In the last three examples, we are animating three photos dropping in from some position on screen.
	
	**NOTE: **Look at how we used **ease** and **Bounce.easeOut**. The **"Bounce**" object has to be imported
	
	**NOTE2: **You can see we used **scrollTrigger**. There is a lot more that can be done with scrollTrigger, but my example is saying **"when the element with this class comes into view, drop the pictures into place".**
