====== Intervals ======
Created Wednesday 19 May 2021

Think of an interval as a duration of time.

**1 Day **== 1 day

**1 D** == 1 day

**1 D 1 M 1 S** == 1 day 1 minute 1 second


**Examples:**
	**SELECT ('1 D 20 H 30 M 45 S'::INTERVAL);**
		- returns **1 day 20:30:45**
		
	Subtraction of INTERVALS:
		**SELECT ('1 D 20 H 30 M 45'::INTERVAL) - ('1 D'::INTERVAL);**
			- returns **20:30:45**
			
	
	Subtract a TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE - INTERVAL:
		{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE - INTERVAL.png}}
		
		Returned a date and time exactly one day less than the timestamp.
		
		
	Find the Amount of days between two dates:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Subtract Timestamps to Find # of Days.png}}
	
	- returned the amount of days between the two timestamps.
	
	
	
	Find the difference between two timestamps with different times and in different time zones:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Timestamp Subtraction with Different Times, Time Zones, etc..png}}
