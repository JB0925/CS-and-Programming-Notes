====== Type Casting ======
Created Wednesday 19 May 2021

Say you want to do a query and you want an integer, but the column is full of strings that are numbers.

You can type cast in your query to get the values you need:

**Syntax:**
	**SELECT (item to select::TYPE) FROM table;**

**Examples:**
	Get an integer from a string:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/PSQL- Type Cast to INT.png}}


	Get a string from an integer:
		**SELECT (price::VARCHAR) FROM products;**
		

There are many more ways to use this.
