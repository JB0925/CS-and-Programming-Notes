====== EXCEPT ======
Created Tuesday 13 April 2021

The **EXCEPT** keyword is used to find all records that are present in the first query, but NOT in the second query.

**EXCEPT ALL** does the same thing, but it includes duplicates, much like UNION does.

**NOTE: **If query #2 has more rows than query #1, those extra rows in query #2 will automatically NOT be included in a larger query with **EXCEPT**.

**NOTE: **The order of queries will have an impact on results. You want the rows you want to keep to be in the first query.

**Example:**
	(
	   SELECT *
	   FROM products
	   ORDER BY price DESC
	   LIMIT 4
	)
	**EXCEPT**
	(
	   SELECT *
	   FROM products
	   ORDER BY price / weight DESC
	   LIMIT 6
	);
	
	**returns only the rows that are present in the first query.**
