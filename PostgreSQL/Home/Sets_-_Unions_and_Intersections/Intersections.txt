====== Intersections ======
Created Tuesday 13 April 2021

The purpose of the **INTERSECT** keyword is to once again have two queries, and this time find **the common rows in BOTH queries.**

Essentially, it's the opposite of **UNION**.

It returns the rows that are found in both queries.


**Example:**
	(
	   SELECT *
	   FROM products
	   ORDER BY price DESC
	   LIMIT 4
	)
	INTERSECT
	(
	   SELECT *
	   FROM products
	   ORDER BY price / weight DESC
	   LIMIT 4
	);



**INTERSECT ALL:**
	Finds rows that are common to both queries. Will return duplicates, as long as there are multiples in one query or the other, **NOT** one result in one query and one result in the other.
