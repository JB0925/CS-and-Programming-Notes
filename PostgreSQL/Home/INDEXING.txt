====== INDEXING ======
Created Tuesday 13 July 2021

An **index** can be placed on a column to speed up querying.

When a column with an index is queried, the query executes in **O(log n)** time instead of **O(n).**

**The difference:**
	Say you have 1,000,000 entries into your database.
	
	**Query using a column with an index:**
		takes 20 actions
	
	**Query without an index:**
		takes up to 1,000,000 actions


**PRIMARY KEYS (**primarily the **id** column in a table), are **indexed** by default.


**Why not use an index on every column?**
	- When you create an index, it creates a tree data structure of that column's data that is used to speed up the query. This ends up taking up a good amount of space.
	
	- INSERT and UPDATE also become expensive, because data in the regular table **AND** the tree structure
