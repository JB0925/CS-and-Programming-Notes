The most important things here are the presence of the FOREIGN KEY relationships, noted in italics. 

**In the MOVIES table, **it has a FOREIGN KEY of **studio_id** that links it to the **STUDIOS** table.

**In the ROLES table,** it has two FOREIGN KEY relationships:
	1). a **movie_id** key to relate it to the **MOVIES** table.
	2). a **actor_id** key to relate it to the **ACTORS** table.
