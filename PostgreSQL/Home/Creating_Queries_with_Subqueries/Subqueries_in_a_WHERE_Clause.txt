Created Wednesday 05 May 2021

You can also run a subquery in a WHERE clause:

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/WHERE Clause Subquery Example.png}}


**Explanation:**
	- The above query is saying to give me all the **prices** from **products **where the **price >** than the **average price of the products**, and to order them in descending order and only give the first 10.
	

**NOTE: You cannot give your WHERE clause Subquery an alias (i.e. AS p, etc.);**
