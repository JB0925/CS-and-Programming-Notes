====== Subqueries in a FROM Statement ======
Created Tuesday 04 May 2021

**NOTE: **A Subquery inside of a FROM can be anything, as long as it is **compatible with the Outer Subquery.**

Here, I selected the rows that had an id greater than or equal to 30.


**Remember, a subquery has to be able to be ran on its own. If you can't, then you can't use it as a Subquery.**

**NOTE: **Anytime you run a subquery in a FROM clause, you HAVE TO use an alias or else it won't work.

In the above example, we are asking for the **name** column from **products**, but then we are asking for a "made up" column that we are sourcing from the FROM subquery. **NOTE:** You have to include any extra columns from your SELECT clause in the FROM subquery as well (**i.e. name**)

**Here, we are selecting the "price" column, and also the made up "price_weight_ratio" column. Notice how both were included in the FROM subquery. Also, be sure to give your FROM subquery a name, i.e. "AS my_table;"**



**Using a Subquery Inside of a FROM Clause to Find the Average Number of Orders:**

**Here we take the max order id and divide it by the max user id to find the average amount of orders.**
