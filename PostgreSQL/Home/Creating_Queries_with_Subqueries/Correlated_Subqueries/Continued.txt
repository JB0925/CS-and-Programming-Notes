Query: Without using a JOIN or GROUP BY, print the number of orders for each product.
	**NOTE:** This is an exercise; using a JOIN or GROUP BY is the best way to do it in practice.


{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Correlated Subquery in SELECT.png}}


This query returns each product name, and how many orders contained that product.

We have an OUTER QUERY, and an INNER SUBQUERY.

The outer query is just getting the name from the products table, but again the **alias of "p1"** is what is most helpful here.

We use the **p1** alias to make a comparison in our subquery.


In the subquery, we get the count of each item in which the **orders.product_id** column matches the **products.id** column.
