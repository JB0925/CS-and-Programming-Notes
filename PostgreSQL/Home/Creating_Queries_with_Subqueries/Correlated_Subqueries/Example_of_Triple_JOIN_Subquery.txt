{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Triple JOIN Subquery.png}}

**Explanation:**
	- We are getting the concatenated first and last name from **users**, the id from **orders**, and the name and price from **products**
	- Then, we run a subquery to pull out the first_name, last_name, and id from **users** 
	- Join that information by pulling out the id, user_id, product_id from **orders**
	- Join them where **orders.user_id = users.id**
	- Join all of that by pulling out the name, price, and id from **products**
	- Join that information with the two tables above where **products.id = orders.product.id**
	- ONLY include those if the **price** is greater than the **average price** from **products**
	- Order all of it by **price** in **descending order**, then by **last_name**
