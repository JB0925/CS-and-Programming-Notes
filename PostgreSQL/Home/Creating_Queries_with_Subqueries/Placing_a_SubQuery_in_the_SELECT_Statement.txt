====== Placing a SubQuery in the SELECT Statement ======
Created Tuesday 04 May 2021

To place a Subquery in the SELECT statement of your query, it must reference only ONE value, also known as a **scalar value**.

**Example:**
	- SELECT (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products) - price AS the_difference
	  FROM products;
	
	**This would return every row's price column, but it would be THE DIFFERENCE between it's price column and the max price in the table.**
