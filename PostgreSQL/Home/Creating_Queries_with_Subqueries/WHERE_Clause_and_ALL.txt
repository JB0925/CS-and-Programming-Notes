====== WHERE Clause and ALL ======
Created Wednesday 05 May 2021

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/ALL with WHERE Clause.png}}


An ALL statement lets us get all of the values from a particular query. Here, we use it with a subquery.


We are asking for the name, department, and price from the products table WHERE the price is greater than ALL the prices in the table where the department is "Industrial".


**Example 2:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Another ALL example.png}}


Here, we are selecting several columns from the products table, but ONLY if their price is less than the AVERAGE price / weight ratio.

Again, we truly didn't HAVE to have a Subquery with an ALL statement in it, but we used it as practice.
