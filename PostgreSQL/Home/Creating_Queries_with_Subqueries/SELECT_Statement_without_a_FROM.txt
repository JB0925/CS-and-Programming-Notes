====== SELECT Statement without a FROM ======
Created Friday 14 May 2021

You can write a valid SELECT clause without using a FROM statement.

This can be done with a subquery, **as long as the subquery returns only one single value**.

This could be useful when you only need one particular value, or you want to get the result of some math problem from a table.
