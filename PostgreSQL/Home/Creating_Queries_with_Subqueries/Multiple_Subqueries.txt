Created Wednesday 05 May 2021

**Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Multiple Subqueries.png}}


**NOTE:** Most of this is totally unnecessary, but was used as an exercise to practice using subqueries.

**Explanation:**
	- We are selecting the **name** and the **price. NOTE:** SELECT clause subqueries can only have one column involved, so if you want more than one, they have to be on the outside.
	
	- We are running a Subquery on the products table to ONLY select the name and price columns.
	
	- We run a subquery in the WHERE clause to get the AVG price, and then filter by saying ONLY items with a price GREATER THAN the average price.
