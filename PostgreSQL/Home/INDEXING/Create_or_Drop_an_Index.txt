Created Tuesday 13 July 2021

You can create an index after your table is created, and you can also drop it:

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);



**Create a multi-column index:**

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1_name, column2_name);




**Drop an index:**

DROP INDEX full_name;
