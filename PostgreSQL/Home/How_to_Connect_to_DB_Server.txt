====== How to Connect to DB Server ======
Created Monday 01 March 2021

**Install Postgres:**
	- **sudo apt-get install postgresql-12**
	- get up and running with postgres:
		- **sudo -i -u postgres**........................................brings up the Postgres server prompt "postgres@jesse..."
		- **sudo -u postgres psql  .......**or just "**psql**"
		
		  **NOTE: **If you need to restart, run **sudo service postgresql restart**
		**  NOTE2: Honestly, "sudo -u postgres psql" seems to work just fine for entering to postgres command prompt**
	
	- to log out of Postgres, use the **\q** command
	- to get out of the Postgres terminal prompt, use **logout** or **Ctrl-d**


**How to Connect to/Create a Database:**
	- once you have the Postgress terminal prompt "postgres@jesse...", run **createdb jesse **(or whatever you want to call it)




**Creating a New Role:**
	- at the Postgres server prompt, enter **createuser --interactive**
		- you will be prompted for name of the "role" to add (**jesse**) and if the new role should be a superuser (**yes**)
		- find out more about the createuser command by using **man createuser**


**Open Postgres Promt with the New Role:**
	- if you have a Linux user with the same name as the role you created, you can run **sudo -u role_name psql**
	- **NOTE: **running the above will prompt you to enter your password. If you've not made one, run the following:
		- exit back to main terminal prompt
		- run **sudo -u role_name psql postgres**
		- run **\password postgress**............**also, try ALTER USER role_name PASSWORD 'password here';**
		- will prompt you to enter the new password twice


**Connect User to a Different Database:**
	- run **psql -d database_name**
	- check current connection information with **\conninfo**
	
	**OR**
	
	- **psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U jesse searchresults**
	if you run the code directly above on a database that doesn't exist, it will not work
	
	once you are verified as having a "role", in the **postgres=#** shell, you can enter **\c database_name**


**To Switch Ownership of a Database:**
	**ALTER DATABASE db_name OWNER TO user_name;**
