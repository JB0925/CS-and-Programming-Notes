**Another Bad Example:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Bad Table Design #2.png}}
	
	Here, the **store_location** is completely dependent upon the **store_id.**
	
	Instead, we will separate them into more tables:

	We separate them into two tables, one for stores, and one for purchases. They are linked by the **store_id** column that both tables have.
