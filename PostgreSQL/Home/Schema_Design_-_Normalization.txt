====== Schema Design - Normalization ======
Created Monday 12 July 2021

Normalization is a design technique that aims to reduce redundancy and dependency of data.

**Bad Example:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Bad Normalization #1.png}}
	
	Here, you can see we have doubled up data in the color column.
	

**Above Table Normalized:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Good Normalization #1.png}}
	
	This example is the first example, but normalized. Here, we have a **products** table and a **colors** table. 
	
	Then we have a **products_colors** table. In this table, we can see that the first id has a **color_id** foreign key that related it to the color **red** from the **colors** table. and the **first** item (**id #1**) from the **products** table.
