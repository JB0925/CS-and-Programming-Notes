**Query:** Find the four highest priced items, AND the four items with the highest price-to-weight ratio.

**SQL to find 4 highest priced items:**
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	ORDER BY price DESC
	LIMIT 4;
	
	Returns the four highest priced items, ranked from most expensive to least.


**SQL to find highest price-to-weight ratio:**
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	ORDER BY price / weight DESC
	LIMIT 4;
	
	Returns the four highest price/weight ratio items, biggest ratio to smallest.
	


**How can we combine these queries?:**
	Use the **UNION** keyword. The purpose of **UNIONb **and **UNION ALL** is to join together two separate queries.
	
	To do so, write both queries with **NO** semicolons, wrap both in separate parentheses and, in between the parentheses, use the **UNION** keyword.
	
	**Example:**
	
	(
	   SELECT *
	   FROM products
	   ORDER BY price DESC
	   LIMIT 4
		)
	**UNION**
	(
		   SELECT *
	   FROM products
	   ORDER BY price / weight DESC
	   LIMIT 4
		);

**NOTE: There are 7 rows, not 8, because one of the rows is present in BOTH queries**

To see all 8 rows, you would use the same syntax as above, just the keywords **UNION ALL** instead of just **UNION.**

Here, we can see that there are 8 rows, and that the row with the product **Incredible Granite Mouse** is listed twice.
