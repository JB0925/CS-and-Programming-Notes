====== What is a Database ======
Created Monday 01 March 2021

A database is a place where you can **store, manipulate, and retrieve data**. Usually stored inside of a computer's server.

Postgres is the database. SQL is the structured query language.

SQL is a programming language. It is very powerful.

Been around since 1974 and is used all over the internet.


**How is data stored?**
	- data stored in tables
	- inside the table, data is stored in columns and rows
	
	- if a table is called **person**, the columns might be **id, first_name, last_name, gender, age**
	- the rows would be related to a specific person
	


**What is a relational database?**
	- a relational database is one where two tables have a link of some kind.
	- for example, a table of people has a **car_id** column, and the table "car" has an **id** column. the **car_id** is the link between the person in the "people" table, and the car in the **car** table.
	
	- another example is in my instrument project. One table, **User** stores user data and another table**, Results** stores search results. It has a **ForeignKey** relationship linking the person to an instance of the **User** table so that all search data with that person's name "belongs to" them.


**What is Postgres?**
	- it is the most advanced open source relational database
	- it is an **object-relational database management system.**
	- it is modern and open source


**Install Postgres:**
	- **sudo apt-get install postgresql-12**
	- get up and running with postgres:
		- **sudo -i -u postgres**
		- **sudo -u postgres psql**
		
		**NOTE: **If you need to restart, run **sudo service postgresql restart**
