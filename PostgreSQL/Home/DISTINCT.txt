====== DISTINCT ======
Created Monday 17 May 2021

To get unique values, use DISTINCT:
	**SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT department)**
	**FROM products;**
	- will return how many unique departments there are in the inventory.


To get unique **combinations of values:**
	**SELECT DISTINCT department, name**
	**FROM products;**
	- will return only results where department and name are a unique combination


**NOTE: **Query #1 above makes use of the **COUNT** function, but you can only use it if you have **ONE** distinct value you are searching for.
