====== Sorting ======
Created Sunday 11 April 2021


To sort, we use **ORDER BY** keywords,

**Example:**
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	**ORDER BY **price;


Sorting, by default, goes from **least to greatest**,. To go the opposite way, use the **DESC** keyword after the ORDER BY keyword:
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	ORDER BY price DESC;
