====== Array Length ======
Created Sunday 11 July 2021

In SQL, an array is made with curly braces { }

to check it's length, use **array_length(col_name, 1) = whatever length you are looking for.**

**Example:**
	SELECT *
	FROM table
	WHERE **array_length(col_name, 1) = 5**
	
	returns all columns where the specified column name has a length of 5.
