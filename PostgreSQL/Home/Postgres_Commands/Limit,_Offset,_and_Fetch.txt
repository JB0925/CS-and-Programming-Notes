====== Limit, Offset, and Fetch ======
Created Tuesday 02 March 2021

Limit is used to select a certain number of results.
Offset basically says "give me all the results after this point
Can use offset and limit together



**Example:**
	**SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;**
		- returns the first 10 results
	
	**SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5;**
		- returns all results starting from the 6th result, all the way to the end
	
	**SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5;**
		- returns results starting at index 6 (OFFSET) and going through index 10 (LIMIT 5)
		
	
	**FETCH** does the same thing as LIMIT, but is the "official" way of doing it
		**SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;**
			- returns results starting from index 6, and gets the first five rows starting after row 5
			- if you wanted to use ORDER BY in this query, it would go after the table name
