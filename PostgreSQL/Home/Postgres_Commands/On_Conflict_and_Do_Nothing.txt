====== On Conflict and Do Nothing ======
Created Friday 05 March 2021

**ON CONFLICT** is similar to error handling in Python. With the ON CONFLICT keyword, we are using it like an **except** block in Python, to catch errors.


**Example:**
	**INSERT INTO car (make, model, price)**
	**VALUES('Ford', 'Escape', '$11,026')**
	**ON CONFLICT (model) DO NOTHING;**
	
	
The example is saying to try to insert the above values into the table called **car**. However, if there is a conflict because there is already a car in the table of the same model, then do nothing. 

**This is often used with a PRIMARY KEY, such as id, where there cannot be any conflicts, or columns that have a constraint.**

**NOTE: ON CONFLICT** does **NOT** work with columns that are not UNIQUE.
