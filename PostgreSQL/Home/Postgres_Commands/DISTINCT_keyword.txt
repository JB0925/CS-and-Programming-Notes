**DISTINCT** is a way to get unique data and information from a table.

**SELECT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth;**
	- will return the country of birth for every person, many of which will be the same


**How to Use DISTINCT to Get Unique Values:**
	- **SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth;**
		- this will give only unique countries of birth, so a lot less values overall


Can be used for almost any column where you want to find unique values
