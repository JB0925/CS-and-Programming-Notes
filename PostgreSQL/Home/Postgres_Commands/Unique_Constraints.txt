====== Unique Constraints ======
Created Thursday 04 March 2021

**UNIQUE constraints allow us to have a unique value for every new entry into a column.**

When using UNIQUE, you will never get two objects with the same information in the column with the UNIQUE constraint.


**Example:**
	**ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE(email);**
		- like PRIMARY KEY, you can pass in more than one column to UNIQUE()



**Drop a Constraint:**
	**ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT unique_email;**
	
	OR
	
	**ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE (email);**
		- difference is the table name is defined by Postgres
