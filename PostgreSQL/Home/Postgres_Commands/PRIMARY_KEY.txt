Primary Key is a unique identifier for objects in a 'PostgreSQL table.
	- in many tables, the unique identifier (PRIMARY KEY) is the ID, created with BIGSERIAL data type, or some variation

If someone already has a primary key value, another object cannot be written into the table with the same primary key.

**How to drop the primary key constraint:**
	**ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT table_name_pkey;**
