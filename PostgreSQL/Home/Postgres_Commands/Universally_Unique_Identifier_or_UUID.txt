====== Universally Unique Identifier or UUID ======
Created Sunday 07 March 2021

The UUID is globally unique, which means that collisions are virtually impossible.

To use UUID, you have to install it from **pg_available_extensions.**

**NOTE: **IF NOT EXISTS means that if whatever it is does not exist, then do the preceeding command, and do it only once.

**How to Install:**
	- **CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";**
		- creates the extension
		- **NOTE: **Must use double quotes around the extension name.


**How to View Available Extension Functions:**
	- **\df** will show all available extensions

**You can invoke a uuid function with a query:**
	- **SELECT uuid_generate_v4;**
		- this will return randomly generated uuids, because that is what UUID V4 does (see online to view what the other functions do)
		- this is very useful for PRIMARY KEY generation
