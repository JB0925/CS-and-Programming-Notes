====== GROUP BY with more than one HAVING ======
Created Monday 12 July 2021

SELECT first_name, last_name, CAST(AVG(price) as int), COUNT(*) 
FROM owners
JOIN vehicles
ON owners.id = vehicles.owner_id
**GROUP BY first_name, last_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND CAST(AVG(price) as int) > 10000**
ORDER BY first_name DESC;

If you were to try the above with a WHERE clause, it would not work because WHERE clauses don't take **aggregate functions**.

To get the same information, we can use **multiple conditions in the HAVING clause.**

Above, we are looking for those who have more than one car **(HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)** AND
we want the avg price of their cars to be greater than 10000 (**AND CAST(AVG(price) as int))**
