====== Create Tables With Constraints ======
Created Tuesday 02 March 2021

It is a good idea to specify constraints into the table to ensure that before someone enters new records into the table, it must satisfy the constraints placed onto the table.

**Example:**
	CREATE TABLE person (
		id BIGSERIAL **NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY**,
		first_name VARCHAR(50) **NOT NULL**,
		last_name VARCHAR(50) **NOT NULL**,
		gender VARCHAR(10) **NOT NULL**,
		date_of_birth DATE **NOT NULL**,
	);

The constraints are placed in bold. **NOT NULL** means that you are not allowed to place an entry into the table without that value.
BIGSERIAL - an autoincrementing 8-bit integer
PRIMARY KEY - what uniquely identifies a person in the actual table, i.e. four people can have the same first and last name (John Smith), but they can never have the same id
