====== UPDATE ======
Created Thursday 04 March 2021

UPDATE allows us to update a column, or multiple columns, based on the WHERE clause that is used.
If no WHERE clause is used, it updates every row.

For example:
	**UPDATE person SET email = 'omar@gmail.com';**
		- would set everyone's email in the **person** table to 'omar@gmail.com 
		- most of the time, we don't want this
	
	
	**UPDATE person SET email = 'omar@gmail.com' WHERE id = 2011;**
		- updates only the person who has the **id** of 2011 
		
	
	**UPDATE person SET first_name = 'Joe', last_name = 'Montana' WHERE id = 100;**
		- updates the first and last name of the person with the **id** of 100


**ALWAYS USE A WHERE CLAUSE.**
