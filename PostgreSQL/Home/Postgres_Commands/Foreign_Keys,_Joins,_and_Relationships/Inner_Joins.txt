====== Inner Joins ======
Created Saturday 06 March 2021

**Inner joins **combine whatever is common in two tables that have a FOREIGN KEY relationship.

**NOTE: Instead of saying ON, you can use USING, if two tables have the same column name. **
**Example:**
	- **SELECT * FROM person3 JOIN car3 USING (car_uid);**
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

**SELECT * FROM person2 JOIN car2 ON person2.car_id = car2.id;**
	- returns a table of all results where the person id is equal to the car id

**How to select specific columns from both tables:**
	- pretty much the same as above, except after the SELECT statement, reference column names with dot notation i.e. **person2.first_name**, etc.
