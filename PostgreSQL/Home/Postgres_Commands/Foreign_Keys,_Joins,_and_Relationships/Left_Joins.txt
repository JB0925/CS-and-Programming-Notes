====== Left Joins ======
Created Saturday 06 March 2021

Left Join is just like an Inner Join, except that it will also return the information of the objects that do not have a match as well.

**Example:**
	The query is almost exactly the same as the Inner Join query
	**SELECT * FROM person2 LEFT JOIN car2 ON person2.car_id = car2.id;**
	
	This is useful for when you want to see which objects have a certain trait, and which ones don't. 
	Example below:
	
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	You can see it also returned the information for Jason, even though he does not own a car.
	


**Further Filtering:**
	**SELECT * FROM person2 LEFT JOIN car2 ON person2.car_id = car2.id WHERE car2.* IS NULL;**
		- same query as above, only returns information for people who have no car
