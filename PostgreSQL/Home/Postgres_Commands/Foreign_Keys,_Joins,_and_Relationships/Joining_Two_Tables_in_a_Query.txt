====== Joining Two Tables in a Query ======
Created Saturday 06 March 2021

The way to make a query where you are looking for something (or things) that are related to an object in another table is to use JOIN and ON.

**Example:**
	**SELECT make, model FROM car2 a JOIN person2 b ON (a.id = b.car_id);**
		- returns a table with the make and model of the car that belong to a specific person that has a **car_id** that matches the **id** column of the car from the **car2** table
