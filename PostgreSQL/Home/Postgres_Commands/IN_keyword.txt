====== IN keyword ======
Created Wednesday 03 March 2021

The **IN **keyword takes an array of values to search, and returns a query matching those values.

**Example:**
	You could write:
		- SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth = 'China'
		OR country_of_birth = 'France' OR country_of birth = 'Brazil';
	
	
	**With IN, you can write:**
		- SELECT * FROM person
		WHERE country_of_birth **IN** ('China', 'France', 'Brazil');
	
	
	**Both queries will return the same things.**
