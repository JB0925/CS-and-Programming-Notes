====== WHERE clause and AND ======
Created Tuesday 02 March 2021

The WHERE clause is a conditional statement

**Example:**
	**SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female';**
		- returns only the rows and columns of people whose gender is female
	
	
	**How to Use Multiple Conditions:**
		**SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female' AND country_of_birth = 'China';**
			- returns all rows and columns for people with gender = Female and country of birth = China
	
	
	Can also add in other statements, such as ORDER BY:
		**SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female' AND country_of_birth = 'China' ORDER BY first_name;**
			- returns the same as directly above, except they will be sorted by first name
	
	
	Can have more than one clause in the AND statement using ( ):
		**SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female' AND (country_of_birth = 'China' OR country_of_birth = 'Russia') ORDER BY first_name;**
			- see above, this time plus Russia


	You can also have Mathematical Clauses in your WHERE statement
		**SELECT * FROM car WHERE price / miles > 500;**
