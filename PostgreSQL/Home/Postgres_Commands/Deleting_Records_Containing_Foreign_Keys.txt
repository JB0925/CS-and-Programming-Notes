====== Deleting Records Containing Foreign Keys ======
Created Sunday 07 March 2021

You cannot immediately delete an object from a table if it has a FOREIGN KEY relationship with an item in another table.

If you want to remove the object from the table, you have to remove the FOREIGN KEY that it is related to from the record in the other table.

**Two Options:**
	- completely delete the object in the other table that has the FOREIGN KEY relationship to the item in the other table.
		- i.e., delete this object first before deleting the other object
	
	- UPDATE the FOREIGN KEY from the other table; set it to NULL, then delete the object from the first table
