====== DELETE ======
Created Thursday 04 March 2021

**DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_val = specific_val;**
	- generic example of deleting from a table


**DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 1;**
	- anyone in the table called **person **with an **id** of 1 will be deleted
	

**DELETE FROM person WHERE gender = 'Female' AND country_of_birth = 'England';**
	- will delete all females from England that are currently in the table

**BE CAREFUL** when deleting. A DELETE statement such as:
		**DELETE FROM person WHERE gender = 'Male';**
			- would delete all males from the table
			- think before pressing enter


It is usually a good idea to delete based on a primary key, if you are trying to delete a single object.

**NEVER run DELETE FROM table_name;**
	- it will delete the entire table
