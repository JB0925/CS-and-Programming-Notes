====== How to Add a Primary Key ======
Created Thursday 04 March 2021

**ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);**
	- **NOTE:** This will not work if more than one object has the same id


**Id is just for example. You can pass in more column names to PRIMARY KEY and have more than one column act as primary key if you want / need to.**
