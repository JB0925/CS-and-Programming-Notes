====== Foreign Keys, Joins, and Relationships ======
Created Friday 05 March 2021

Foreign keys allow us to connect members of one table to members of another table.

Here we have the **person** table:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

And here is the **car** table:
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

We are going to add a column with a FOREIGN KEY to the **person** table, to connect a person with a car. The column will be called **car_id.**

**Syntax:**
	**car_id BIGINT REFERENCES car(id), UNIQUE (car_id)**
	
	In order to create a table with the statement above, you need to
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
	

**Set a Value for the "car_id" FOREIGN KEY:**
	- **UPDATE person2 SET car_id = 1 WHERE id = 1;**
		- this means that whoever has the id of 1, their car id is also 1
		
	- If we were to run the statement:
		**UPDATE person2 SET car_id = 1 WHERE id = 2;**
			- we would get an error about duplicate values.
			- This is because we specified the "car_id" as UNIQUE
