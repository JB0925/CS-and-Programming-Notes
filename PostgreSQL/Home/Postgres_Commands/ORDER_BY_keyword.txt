====== ORDER BY keyword ======
Created Tuesday 02 March 2021

ORDER BY gets our information, and orders it by ascending or descending order
Default for ORDER BY is ASCENDING order
**Can use ORDER BY with dates, numbers, and strings**

**ASC** = ascending, **DESC** = descending

**SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name;**
	- orders all people in the table alphabetically by their country of birth; default is ASCENDING
	- people who were born in a country starting with A will be first, etc.
	- can add **ASC** to the end, but it is default


**SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name DESC;**
	- same as above, but descending this time


Can also use two or more columns to sort:
	**SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY id, email DESC;**
		- returns all rows and columns in table, sorted by id and email, and in descending order
