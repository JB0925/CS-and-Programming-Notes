The LIKE operator is used to match text values against a pattern, using wildcards.

**Here, the "%" character also means "any character".**

**Examples:**
	**SELECT * FROM table WHERE email LIKE '%.com';**
		- returns a list of people who have email addresses that match the pattern, in this case email addresses that end in **.com**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	The pattern was **'[[anything@bloomberg.com|anything]]**[[anything@bloomberg.com|@bloomberg.com]]', and one result matched the pattern.
	
	
	**Another example to catch regional Google email addresses, like google.uk.co, etc.**
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	


**ILIKE:**
	- same as above, only case insensitive
	**SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth ILIKE 'p%';**
		- is a case insensitive search for countries that begin with P
