Go to mockaroo.com, create your columns, **MAKE SURE EVERYTHING MATCHES YOUR TABLE**

Select SQL, dowload the file

Go to VSCode, edit the CREATE TABLE statement to match your table EXACTLY, save everything as is

In another Ubuntu terminal, navigate to where you saved the file (Downloads) and copy the **pwd**

Go back to your **psql terminal**

At the prompt, paste in the **pwd** of the file, then **forward-slash** and **file_name.sql**

Press Enter, and the data will populate your table

At the end, go back and add an **id** column to the table:
	ALTER TABLE person
	ADD COLUMN id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY;
