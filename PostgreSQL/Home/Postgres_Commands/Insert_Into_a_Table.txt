====== Insert Into a Table ======
Created Tuesday 02 March 2021

**How to Insert Records into Tables:**
	- let's say we want to insert into our table the following information:
		**id=1, first_name=Anne, last_name=Smith, gender=FEMALE, date_of_birth=09/01/88**
		
	**Syntax for an INSERT Statement:**
		INSERT INTO table_name (
			first_name,
			last_name,
			gender,
			date_of_birth)
		VALUES ('Anne', 'Smith', 'FEMALE', DATE '1988-01-09');		#**DATE is yyyy-mm-dd**
	
	**NOTE:** Notice after **date_of_birth** we closed parentheses, but did not include the semicolon until after the VALUES statement.
	
	**Example INSERT Statement, followed by a query to show that the data was saved:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	**Example With an Email:**
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	
	**NOTE:	**You could just make the INSERT statement on one line, and the VALUES statement on one line.
