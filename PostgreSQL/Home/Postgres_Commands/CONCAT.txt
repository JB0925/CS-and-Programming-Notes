====== CONCAT ======
Created Sunday 28 March 2021

CONCAT is used to concatenate two or more strings together. There are two ways to concatenate strings in Postgres:

**SELECT CONCAT(col1, ', ', col2) FROM table;**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

and

**SELECT col1 | | ', ' | | col2 FROM table;**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}
