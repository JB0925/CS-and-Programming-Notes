**Example:**
	**SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person;**
		- returns a big list of unique country names
	
	
	**SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth;**
		- COUNT(*) is an SQL function that returns a count of the number of times it sees a particular value

		Above is a small snippet of what was returned from running the SELECT statement above.
		You can see that 117 people were from **Indonesia**, and 27 people were from **Sweden**, etc.
