====== HAVING ======
Created Friday 02 April 2021

You will never see HAVING without GROUP BY.

GROUP BY filters out groups. 


**Example: Find all photos with more than 2 comments where the photo's id is less than 3**

SELECT photo_id, COUNT(*)
FROM comments
WHERE photo_id < 3
GROUP BY photo_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;


**Example: Find all users where the user has commented on the first two photos and added more than 2 comments on those photos**

SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM comments
WHERE photo_id <= 2
GROUP BY user_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
