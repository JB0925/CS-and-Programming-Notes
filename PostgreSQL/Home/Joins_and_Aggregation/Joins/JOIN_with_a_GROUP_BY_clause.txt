====== JOIN with a GROUP BY clause ======
Created Friday 02 April 2021

Say we have a users table, and a photos table.
The photos table has a foreign key of "user_id", that shows which photos belong to which users.
In order to write a query to get usernames AND a count of how many photos each user posted, you can use the below:

SELECT username, COUNT(*)
FROM users
JOIN photos
ON users.id = photos.user_id
GROUP BY username;
