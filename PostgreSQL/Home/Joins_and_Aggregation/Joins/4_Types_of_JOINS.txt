====== 4 Types of JOINS ======
Created Wednesday 31 March 2021

**INNER JOIN **- this is the standard JOIN that you learn in the beginning. This join WILL NOT return information for any parties where the ON condition is not a match

**LEFT JOIN - **same style of JOIN as above, except that it WILL return all information for the table on the LEFT of the JOIN keyword, whether it has a match in the other table or not.

**RIGHT JOIN **- same as LEFT JOIN, except that it will return all information for the table on the RIGHT of the JOIN keyword, whether it has a match in the other table or not.

**FULL JOIN **- same syntax, except that it returns all results, whether there are matches or not. If there is a match, it will return the selected columns from BOTH tables. If not, it will still return whatever is available from both columns, and leave empty or NULL for the missing values.
