====== Three Way JOIN ======
Created Wednesday 31 March 2021

Say you want to SELECT contents, url, username where all have the same user id. In order to do this, you'd have to do a three way JOIN.

**Example:**
	SELECT contents, url, username
	FROM comments
	JOIN photos ON comments.user_id = photos.user_id
	JOIN users ON users.id = comments.user_id AND users.id = photos.user_id;
