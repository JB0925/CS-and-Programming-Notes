====== Joins ======
Created Wednesday 31 March 2021

Joins are typically used when you are trying to find information related to multiple tables.
**NOTES:**
	- table order between FROM and JOIN frequently makes a difference
	- we must give context if column names collide (i.e SELECT car.id, person.id, etc.)
	- tables can be renamed with AS
		- after the FROM and before the JOIN you can use AS my_table, and the reference everything from that table by my_table.id
		- you can even leave off the AS (i.e. **SELECT * FROM photos p**)

	- more than one kind of JOIN (LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, etc.)
