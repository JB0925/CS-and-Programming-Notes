====== Creating Queries with Subqueries ======
Created Wednesday 14 April 2021

A **subquery **is a type of query where one part of the query is dependent upon another part.

Let's say we want to list the **name, price** from the **products** table, but only if the price of the item is more expensive than the most expensive item from the Toys department.

We can't do this query unless we know the price of the most expensive item from the Toys department.


So, we might first have to run a query:
	SELECT MAX(price)
	FROM products
	WHERE department = 'Toys';
	
	
	**This will give us 876.**


So now, we can run our second query:
	SELECT name, price
	FROM products
	WHERE price > 876;


**You can combine the two with a Subquery.**

**Example:**
	SELECT name, price
	FROM products
	WHERE price > (
		SELECT MAX(price) FROM products WHERE department = 'Toys'
	);
	
	
	**The query inside the parentheses is executed first by the database, then the first query is executed.**
