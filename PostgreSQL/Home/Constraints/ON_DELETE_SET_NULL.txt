====== ON DELETE SET NULL ======
Created Wednesday 31 March 2021

**Example:**

CREATE TABLE photos (
	id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	url VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) **ON DELETE SET NULL**
);

With **ON DELETE CASCADE**, if you delete the entry that a foreign key is related to, it will also delete the foreign key entry.

With **ON DELETE SET NULL**, you can delete the entry the foreign key is related to, but the foreign key entry's foreign key column is set to **NULL**.
