====== ON DELETE CASCADE ======
Created Tuesday 30 March 2021

**ON DELETE CASCADE **is often used when we want to delete all information when a user is deleted.

To use ON DELETE CASCADE, you add it to the Foreign Key declaration when creating the table.

**Example:**

CREATE TABLE photos (
	id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	url VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) **ON DELETE CASCADE**
);
