====== CSS Variables ======
Created Saturday 20 February 2021

Variables can be used in a similar manner to Python classes. 

Basically, you create a main CSS class and give it one or more variables, which you can then use in other classes (**almost like "self"**)

**Syntax:**
	- {{.\pasted_image.png}}
	In the example above, you can see the **variables** notated with **--var-name: value;**
	To use them in another class, do the following:
	
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	You can see that it's basically like calling a Python function called **var**, with the argument being initially called it's name, followed by a **comma** and then the value, closed parentheses, and a semicolon.
	**NOTE:** The **, gray** portion is called a **fallback value**, meaning that if something happens and the initial style or color can't show up, then use this color instead.
