====== Browser Fallbacks for Variables ======
Created Saturday 20 February 2021

Some older browsers do not support usage of CSS variables.

If you use a CSS variable to declare something, a good idea is to declare a browser fallback.

The CSS variable will get first priority, and then the browser will fall back to the more traditional declaration if it cannot parse the CSS variable.


**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Here, a CSS variable is used to set the background. If a browser cannot parse the variable, it will fall back to the first **background** declaration.
