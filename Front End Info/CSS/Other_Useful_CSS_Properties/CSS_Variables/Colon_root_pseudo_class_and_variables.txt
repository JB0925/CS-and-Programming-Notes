====== Colon root pseudo class and variables ======
Created Saturday 20 February 2021

Using '**:root **as a CSS selector is like a global variable and any other element or class will have access to any styles inside of root
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Here we have the variable **--penguin-belly** set to the value of **pink.**

We can then use that variable in any other element, class, or id declaration in the CSS document.

**Example of the --penguin-belly variable being used globally:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

Here, the body element is inheriting from the '**:root** pseudo class, and the entire background is now pink. The hex color after the variable is a fall back color.

**NOTE: you can use this variable in other classes and just write it as normal i.e. "--penguin-belly: white;" to overwrite the initial value.**
