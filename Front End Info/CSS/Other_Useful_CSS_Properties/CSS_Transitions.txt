Created Tuesday 16 February 2021

Transitions allow us to animate the property of one property value to another property value

take this class, and the pseudo class that is grouped with it:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

In the div that inherits from this class, no transitions have taken place, but there are changes happening to the div **immediately**.

But we can **transition** between them more gracefully if we want to by adding **transition: 1s; **to the circle class
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}



With **transition**, you can specify **property name, duration, timing function, **and **delay**.


**Property Name - Syntax:**
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}


if you add another number after the **3s**, it is a delay

You can also specify **all** if you want to apply the transition to all elements in the class.



**Transitions Timing Function:**
	- tells how much time it will take for the action to complete
	{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
	
Another way to use this is to specify **transition-timing-fuction **under transition. This can make some really cool effects happen.

{{.\pasted_image004.png}}


You can also **forego** the **transition-timing-function** selector and declare all in the **transition selector:**
{{.\pasted_image005.png}}

Again, the syntax goes **property name, duration, timing function, delay.**

Definitely select the property names at least; don't just say **all**.



You can also modify more than one property at a time by using a comma:
{{.\pasted_image006.png}}
