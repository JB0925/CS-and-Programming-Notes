====== Width and Height ======
Created Monday 15 February 2021

**The Box Model:**
	- The box model is the idea that everything in CSS/HTML is just a box, and those boxes have a couple of different properties
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	

**The width is the distance from side to side of the box.**
**The height is the distance from bottom to top of the box.**


Width and height control the inner **content** box (shown above).

By default, a container, h1, p, etc., all have their width set to be the entirety of the screen (**even if the content doesn't take up the wole screen**). If you use the **width** property, you can narrow how far these spread across the screen.

Same for height, except it will control how tall the element is.
