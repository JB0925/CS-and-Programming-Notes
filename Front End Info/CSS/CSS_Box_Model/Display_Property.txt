Some elements are **block** elements by default, and some are **inline** by default. For example, **h1's** are block elements and **spans** are inline.

**Examples:**
	**h1 {**
		**display: inline;**
	**}**
	
By doing this, you are putting the**<h1>** elements side by side (**inline**) instead of their default **block**. Essentially, you are getting rid of the default **<br>**.

With **inline elements**, width, height, padding, etc. are ignored, no matter what you write in the style sheet.

The way around this is to use **display: inline-block;**


**display: inline-block; ** is a way to take block elements and turn them into **inline** elements, but still respect width, height, etc., **which is unline inline elements.**



**NOTE:** using **display: none;** will hide, but not delete an element.
