====== Including Styles Correctly ======
Created Monday 08 February 2021

The recommended way to write in CSS styles is with an outside stylesheet that you link to each html document. 

You **CAN** also do it "**inline"** i.e., inside of each element tag.

You **CAN **also add it with the **<style>** tag inside of the head section.


**Neither of the above two is recommended.**

The reason that the last two ways is NOT recommended is because it is impossible to share those styles with anyone else, and it makes your code harder to read.
