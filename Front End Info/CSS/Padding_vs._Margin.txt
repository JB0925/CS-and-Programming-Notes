====== Padding vs. Margin ======
Created Thursday 11 February 2021

**Padding **is the amount of space between the content of an element and its own border.

**Margin **is the amount of space between an element and the overall border

In CSS, you can specify both a **class/element/hook's** padding and margin properties using **clockwise notation**, which is as follows:
	**top, right, bottom, left**


So, **margin: 20px 10px 10px 20px;** means to set the **top and left** margins to 20 pixels, but the **right and bottom** margins to 10 pixels.
