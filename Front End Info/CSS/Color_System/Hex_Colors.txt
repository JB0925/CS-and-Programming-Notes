====== Hex Colors ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

Hex colors are still based on having three channels based from 0-255 each (**RGB**), but hex colors are obviously written using Hexadecimal numbers.

A hexadecimal color number has 6 digits: first two are the **red **channel, **second two** are the **green** channel, **last two** are the **blue** channel

**You can find an online color picker that will give you hex numbers for each color in the picker.**

**NOTE:**
	- if you have hex numbers that are where all of the sets of two are duplicates (**#000000 or #FF88CC**), you can shorten them to three digits:
			- **#000000 = #000**
			- **#FF88CC = #F8C**
			- **AADD65 = has to be writen like it is, because the last pair are not duplicates**
