====== Pseudo Classes ======
Created Wednesday 10 February 2021

**Examples:**

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Pseudo Classes are keyword arguments that specify a special state of a selected element. **They are modifiers.**

**They always start with a ":"**

**Example:**
	'**button:hover {**
		**background-color: blue;**
	**}**



The '**:active **pseudo class pertains to times when you click a link and, while you are clicking on it, it turns a different color or something else happens to it.

**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}		{{.\pasted_image002.png}}		{{.\pasted_image003.png}}


Remember, **p + button **is an **adjacent selector**, meaning that the second element **(button**) comes **directly after** the first element (**p**).
When clicked on (**when it is active**), the orange button will turn purple.



**Nth-of-type(n):**
	if you use **p:nth-of-type(3)**, it will only change the 3rd element**.**
	if you change it to **p:nth-of-type(3n)**, it will change it to every third element
	

**How to Color a Checkerboard:**
	- say your class is "square" and you want odd squares red, and even squares black
	- **.square {**
		  **background-color: red;**
	  }
	
	- '**.square:nth-of-type(2n) {**
		   **background-color: black;**
	   **}**
