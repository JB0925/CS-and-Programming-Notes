====== Direct Descendent Selector ======
Created Wednesday 10 February 2021

**Direct Descendent / Direct Child:**
	- selects only the (**element 2s**) that **ARE** children of (**element 1**)
	


**Example:**
	
	- **div > li {**
		**color: white;**
**         }**



**Explanation:**
	- mostly the same as adjacent selectors, except that the **direct child/descendent** selects only those elements that are children of the first element.
	- **NOTE: Direct descendent does NOT mean doubly/triply, etc., nested. Has to be the FIRST CHILD of the parent element.**
	- in the example, we are selecting **li** tags that are **children** of **div tags**.
	
	**NOTE: This is not as commonly used as the "Descendent Selector" or the "Adjacent Selector"**
