====== ID Selector ======
Created Wednesday 10 February 2021

**NOTE: **An **id** should **ONLY** be used once. This is because you are trying to create a **hook** to single out the one element.

In addition to using **id** attributes to associate a **label** with an **input**, we can use **ids** to style **one** particular element on a page individually.

To do this, give the **individual element you are trying to style an id.**

Then, in your css file, choose that **id** by writing **#idname**, and writing your css as you normall would. **This is called a "hook".**


**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}		{{.\pasted_image.png}}		{{.\pasted_image002.png}}


**Only that one button has that color.**
