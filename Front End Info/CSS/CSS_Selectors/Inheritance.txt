====== Inheritance ======
Created Sunday 14 February 2021

Inheritance deals with how the child element of a parent **inherit** the styles of the parent **IF **no styles have been given to those elements.

**Example:**
	**body {**
		**color: purple;**
	**}**


Let's pretend our HTML looks like this:
<html>
<head>
	<title>Some Title</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="#">Link 1</a>
	</ol>
	
**If NO style has been given for the <h1> and <li> elements, they will INHERIT the style of the body.**

If we add this to our styles:
	**h1 {**
		**color: blue;**
	**}**

Then the h1 will turn blue and no longer inherit the style from its parent.



**NOTE:** if you want an element to inherit from its parent, you can use** inherit**:
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

In this example, the **button** and **input** elements are **inheriting** from their parent, the **form** element.
