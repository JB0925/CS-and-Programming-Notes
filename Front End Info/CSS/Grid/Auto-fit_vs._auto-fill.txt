====== Auto-fit vs. auto-fill ======
Created Wednesday 12 May 2021

Remember this:

	**.container {**
		**grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));**
	**}**
	
	
	- This would end up stretching each column up until 1fr, UNTIL it hit the next 100px threshold, and then it would add another column to the row.
		- with **auto-fit**, these items would keep growing if there were no more items to add to the row
		- **the syntax for auto-fill is the same**. The difference is that, with **auto-fill**, the items continue to stay at the 100px threshold, and new, empty, grid columns are created.
