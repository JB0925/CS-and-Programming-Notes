====== Template Areas ======
Created Tuesday 11 May 2021

To use Template Areas, you have to give your **container** the **grid-template-areas** property, as shown below:

	**grid-template-areas:**
		"h h h h h h h h h h h h"
		"m c c c c c c c c c c c"
		"f f f f f f f f f f f f";
		
	**NOTE:** You have to give **grid-template-areas **the exact same amount of strings per line as you have **columns**.
	
	
	Now, you give your individual classes a **grid-area** letter from the **grid-template-areas** above, and your content will grow to match.
	
	For instance, if you give **.menu** {**grid-area: m;}**, it will fill in the first column, all the way from the bottom of the header, to the top of the footer.

	**The above results in the layout to the right.**
	

**NOTE:** If you use a **period** in the **container's "grid-template-areas"** property, it will make that section of the grid be blank / cancelled out.
