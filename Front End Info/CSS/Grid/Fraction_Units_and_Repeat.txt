====== Fraction Units and Repeat ======
Created Tuesday 11 May 2021

**Fraction units** allow for the entire grid to be responsive, because they tell the code to let the items grow as the container grows.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Introduction to Fraction Units-CSS Grid.png}}

This tells my code to make three columns, each column taking up 1 fraction unit of the space, no matter how big the container grows. 

The rows will still be 50px tall due to the **grid-template-rows** that has been set. Below is the result:

**Repeat:**
	- **repeat()** allows us to do the same thing we did above with **grid-template-columns**, just with a different syntax.
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Using Repeat - CSS Grid.png}}
	
	The above says to make 3 columns, each set to **1fr**. This is the same as the code above, just with a less complicated / shorter syntax.
	
	
	Repeat can also be used with **grid-template-columns** in the same manner / same syntax. Can use pixel vaues as well.
	


**Shorthand for Repeat:**
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Repeat Shorthand - CSS Grid.png}}
	
	
	The code directly above will accomplish the same as either of the code snippets above it. 
	**NOTE:** Remember, **rows** come first, **then columns** when using this shorthand style.
