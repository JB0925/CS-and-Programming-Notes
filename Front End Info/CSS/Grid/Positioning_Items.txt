====== Positioning Items ======
Created Tuesday 11 May 2021

We start out with:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 1.png}}

Which produces:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 1a.png}}
	
	**NOTE:** even though a third row has been defined, there is no third row yet because we have **four** divs taking up **five** space requirements.
	

**Stretch the Header Across the Page:**
	To do that, in the **.header** class for the header div, set **grid-column-start: 1; **and **grid-column-end: 3;**
	- grid column end is the **end of the page**. This will make the header span across, and it will also make the third row begin to populate, as the footer div gets pushed down there. **NOTE: **An alternative, shorthand way to achieve the same thing is just to use **grid-column: 1 / 3;**, as seen below to the right. Both the code on the left and the right achieve the same colored divs seen below.
	
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 2.png}}		{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 2b.png}}
	
	
	Result:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 2a.png}}
	


**Make the Footer Stretch Across the Page:**
	- To make the footer stretch across, you would do the same thing as you did to the **.header class**
		**.footer {**
			**grid-column: 1 / 3;**
		**}**
		
		OR
		
		**.footer {**
			**grid-column: 1 / span 2;**
		**}**
		
		OR
		
		**.footer {**
			**grid-column 1 / -1**
		**}**
		
		
	- you could also do it using only the difference between the **numerator **and **denominator:**
		**.footer {**
			**grid-column: span 2;**
		**}**
		
	
	And the result:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 3.png}}
	
	
**Divy up the space between the Content and the Menu:**
	- Normally, we want more space for the content, and we want the menu to be a sort of sidebar. To make this flexible, add more columns than you might need at the time, and set the **menu** and **column** to span across certain amounts of the space
	
	**Example:**
	
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 4.png}}
	
	Here, we've turned our space into a grid of 12 units that are 1 fraction each. We can now set the content to take up most of the space, and the menu to take up just a part of the space.
	
	Using **grid-column**, I set the **menu** to have a grid column spanning from the first column (far left) to the third column.
	
	Also using **grid-column**, I set the **content** to have a grid column spanning from the **third** column, all the way to the end (**-1**).
	
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 4b.png}}
	
	
	Result:
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Grid Positioning - 4a.png}}
	
	

**Make the Menu Stretch to the Top:**
	- to do this, you have to make the space available to the **menu**, so you have to remove the left most part of the header. Set header to **grid-column {3 / -1};**
	
	Use **grid-row** to set the new height of the menu:
		- **grid-row: {1 / 3};**
		- this makes it as tall as the first row, and go down through to the footer.
		
		- **make it as tall as the view height:**
			- again, change the **.footer {grid-column: 3 / -1}**
			- then, set **.menu {grid-row: 1 / -1}**
