====== justify and align content ======
Created Wednesday 12 May 2021

**justify-content: end;** pushes items to the end (right) of the row axis. **start** does the opposite (pushes to the left).
**justify-content: center;** pushes all items in the container to the center of the row axis. **Items are not centered vertically **(hint: align-content)

**align-content: start, end, and center.**
	- these properties align the content **vertically** (from top to bottom)
		- **start **= top
		- **center** = middle
		- **end** = bottom


**NOTE:** Setting **justify-content: center;** and **align-content: center;** will fully center the container vertically AND horizontally.



**justify-content: space-between, space-evenly, space-around**
	- these do the same thing as they do in flexbox **along the row axis.**
