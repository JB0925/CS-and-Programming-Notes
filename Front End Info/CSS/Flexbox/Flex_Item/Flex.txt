**Flex** determines how an element wll grow to fit the available space in a container.

**Flex** is shorthand for three different properties: **flex-grow, flex-shrink, **and** flex-basis**

**Flex-basis:**
	- specifying the ideal size of an item BEFORE its placed into the container.
	- can use **px**, **%**, etc. to set the **flex-basis**
	- **example of align-self (**div one is aligned to the start of the cross-axis) and **flex-basis** (div two is set to 50% of the **main-axis**)
	- if **display: flex;** in the container, the **main-axis** is the vertical axis, and the item would now have a **height** that is 50% of the **main-axis**
