====== Order ======
Created Sunday 09 May 2021

**Order** is used to specify the order in which the items are displayed.

The **default value** for **order** is 0.

So each item has an order of 0 by default.


**If you want an item to be ordered first, it MUST have a lower number than the other items. **

**NOTE: You can use negative numbers.**


**Example:**
	- if you have four boxes, and want box #3 to move to the front, you have to either:
		a). give that box an order of -1
		b). keep the order for that box unset, and give all other boxes an order of 1.
