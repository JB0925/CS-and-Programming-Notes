====== Flex Shrink ======
Created Sunday 09 May 2021

Flex Shrink dictates when, **if there is not enough space in a content box for everything to fit appropriately, how to shrink an item so that all items will fit.**

**Example:**
	- flex container **flex-wrap** is NOT on, **flex-direction** set to row
	- every box has a **flex-basis** of 50%
	- then, if you select one box and give it a **flex-shrink** of 10, it will be 10x as small as the others
