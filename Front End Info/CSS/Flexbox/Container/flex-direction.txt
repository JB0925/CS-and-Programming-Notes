====== flex-direction ======
Created Tuesday 04 May 2021

A flexbox container has a **flex-direction** property.
It is set to **row** by default.

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/flex-direction: unset.png}}

Above is the standard flexbox layout, **without flex-direction set.**


**flex-direction: row-reverse;**
	This is what happens when we set the **container class **to **row-reverse**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/flex-direction: row-reverse;.png}}

Content goes from **right to left** under **row-reverse. **This is across the main axis.


**flex-direction: column;**

Setting the **flex-direction** to **column** will stack the content vertically:

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/flex-direction: column.png}}


**NOTE: **Setting the **flex-direction** to **column** will change the main axis to the **vertical axis.**



**flex-direction: column-reverse;**
	- does the same as **column**, it just reverses it
