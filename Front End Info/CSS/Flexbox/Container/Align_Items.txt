====== Align Items ======
Created Wednesday 05 May 2021

Align items sets the alignment of items on the **cross-axis.**

**align-items: flex-start;**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Align-Items: Flex-Start.png}}
The **flex** property is set to **row**, so the cross-axis is vertical. The items are aligned to the top of the container.


**align-items: flex-end;**
	- does the opposite. The cross-axis is vertical, so the items are aligned to the bottom of the screen.
	

**align-items: center;**
	- aligns the items in the center of the cross-axis. **Setting justify-content AND align-items to "center" will center the content in the middle of the screen.**
	

**align-items: stretch;**
	- this is the default without even setting **align-items**. Setting **align-items** to **stretch** stretches them to fit the entirety of the cross axis from top to bottom. **Even if each item has its own "height" property, if you set "align-items" to "stretch", it will fill the container along the cross-axis.**
	
**align-items: baseline;**
	- aligns the items on the cross axis along the baseline of their text.
