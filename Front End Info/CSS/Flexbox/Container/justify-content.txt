Created Wednesday 05 May 2021

**justify-content** defines how space is distributed between items in the flex container, along the main axis.


**justify-content: default**
	- this is what it would look like with **justify-content **not set at all

**justify-content: flex-end;**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/justify-content: flex-end.png}}
	- This pushes all of the content to be flush with the end of the container.
	
	**NOTE: justify-content: flex-start;** would do the opposite



**justify-content: center;**
	- This centers all of the items

**justify-content: space-between;**
	- This takes the whitespace and **evenly distributes it between the items.**

**justify-content: space-around;**
	- takes the whitespace and evenly distributes it **around** the items
