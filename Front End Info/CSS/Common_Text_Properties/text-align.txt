====== text-align ======
Created Wednesday 10 February 2021

**h1 {**
   **text-align: center;**
   **width: 50%;**
	}


The above example would center all **h1** tags in the middle of the screen.
**NOTE: **changing the **width** property can make for some unexpected changes. For example, above I set the width to 50%. All **h1's** will still right align, but **now** the **h1** element only goes 50% of the way across the screen, whereas **before** it went 100% of the way across the screen. So it will still be right aligned, but only to its 50% margin.
