====== font-weight ======
Created Wednesday 10 February 2021

**Font-weight** is how we control the boldness, or lightness, of a piece of text.

Typically, **400** is the normal **font-weight**, whereas **700** is **bold. **Anything less than 400 would be considered light.
**NOTE:** not every font has every available weight to choose from. If you try to use a font-weight that is not availble to a particular font, your browser will use the next closest font-weight available.
