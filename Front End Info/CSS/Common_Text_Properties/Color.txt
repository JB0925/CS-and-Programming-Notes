====== Color ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

The **color** property changes the color of the **text**, not the **background.**

The **background-color** property changes the color of the background of the object.
	- if you change the **background-color** property of something like an **h2**, remember, it changes the background color of that section of the body, which goes across the entire page.
	- **NOTE: **You can also use the **background** property to change the background color of an element, but it is best to use **background-color** because **background** can do a lot more than just change color.
