====== Font Size ======
Created Wednesday 10 February 2021

The font size property changes the size of the font.

There are many, many choices when you want to choose a different font. We will look at pixels first:

**Pixels or px:**

	- the most commonly used absolute unit (will always be the same in a document)
	- it is **CALLED** a **pixel** but does **NOT** necessarily equal the width of one pixel on our machine
	- pixels are **NOT** recommended for responsive websites
