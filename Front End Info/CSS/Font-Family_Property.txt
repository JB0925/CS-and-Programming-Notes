====== Font-Family Property ======
Created Monday 08 February 2021

The **font-family** property is what we use to actually change the font of an element:

Changing fonts is not as simple as we think, because it depends on what fonts are installed in your browser.

If you use a font that your browser does not support, the text will still show, but not in the font that you intended.

**Simple Font Changing:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}		{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**The example above is called a "font-stack", and is much more common than just choosing one font because this allows you to have backups if a browser does not support your main font.**

The last in the list above, **sans-serif**, means to choose any available font from the **sans-serif** family.
