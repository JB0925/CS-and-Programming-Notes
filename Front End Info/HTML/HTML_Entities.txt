HTML Entities are used to display special characters on a page.

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**Example:**
	- a diamond, a copyright symbol, a cross, etc.
	- also used when you want to use a symbol that is significant to the syntax of HTML (i.e. <, >)
	- instead of "1 < 6", write "1 &lt; 6"

	- to find the codes, search for **HTML Entity Codes**
	- you can also use an **Entity Number** to do the same thing
