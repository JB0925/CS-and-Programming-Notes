====== Block vs. Inline Elements ======
Created Friday 05 February 2021

**Block Elements: **things like **<h1>, <h2>, <p>**
	- they take up a whole "block" of space
	

**Inline Elements**: things like **<a>**
	- they share the space with other elements
	
	
**What is a <div>?:**
	- a **<div>** is a content divider that takes up an entire block (**Block Element**)
	- it takes up an entire block, and forces other content above or below it
	- allow us to group content together and style it all at once


**What is a <span>?:**
	- a **<span>** is an inline element, used to single out a single, generic element that we wish to style later
