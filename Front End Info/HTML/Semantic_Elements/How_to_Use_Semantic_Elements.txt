**Main tag:**
	- refers to the main body of a page, does NOT include things that are repeated on multiple pages such as a navbar, search form, etc.
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	- small snippet, but the **main** tag goes right inside the body, and the closing tag goes right before the closing **body** tag. Includes everything relevant to ONLY THAT PAGE.
	

**Nav tag:**
	- refers to all navigation links
	- can be in more than one place on a page
