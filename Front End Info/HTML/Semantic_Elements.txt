====== Semantic Elements ======
Created Friday 05 February 2021

**What are semantic elements?**
	- they are elements that give a particular meaning to a piece of HTML
	- instead of constantly using divs to create blocks of content, you can use tags such as **<nav>, <main>, <header>, <footer>, etc.**
	- these tags give meaning to each block, so that someone inspecting the code knows what they represent
	- it makes your code more accessible to people who are using screenreaders (**i.e. people with disabilities**)
