====== Range and Text Areas - Forms ======
Created Friday 05 February 2021


Use the **range** setting of the **type** attribute of the **input** tag to create a slider that goes between a certain range.

**Example:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	

Use the **number** option for the **type **attribute to make a box to enter numbers in. You can set a min and max value, and a **step** value if you'd like. See above. 

**NOTE: **The button in the picture above will not submit anything because it is not connected to a form.



**Textarea:**
	- a multiline input where you can type multiple lines of text to explain something, tell a story, etc.
	**Example:**
		{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
		
		**NOTE:** By adding the **submit** button inside the form, it works as an actual submit button instead of just decoration.
