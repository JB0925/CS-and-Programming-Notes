====== Buttons ======
Created Friday 05 February 2021

Buttons are created like so:
	- **<button>Enter text here</button>**

By default, buttons will submit your form, **UNLESS** they are not in the form to begin with. You can use **Javascript** to make a button submit information outside of the form.

To change the default value, add a **type** attribute inside of the **button** element, and set it equal to **type="button"**

**Example:**
	- **<button type="button">Text Here</button>**


Another way to create a **submit** button is to use the **input** element:
	- This is not recommended
	- **<input type="submit">**
	- **<input type="submit" value="submit">			**# the value attribute allows us to change the text of the button



**Radio Buttons:**
	- to create a radio button, use the **<input>** tag
	- **<input type="radio" name="size" id="size1">**
	
	- to associate buttons together, give them all the same name. This will ensure that you can only click on one button at a time.
	- **NOTE: **make sure to add the **value** attribute. This ensures that this value will be sent to the server, and is important for distinguishing between items
	

**Select Menu:**
	- to create a **select** menu, use the **<select>** tag
	**Example:**
		{{.\pasted_image.png}}		{{.\pasted_image001.png}}


	- **NOTE:** You can also include a placeholder option by setting the **value** attribute to "" and setting the text to something like "**Please make a choice"**
	- just as you can add **checked** to a checkbox input, you can also add **selected** to any option tag, and it will be preselected for you
