====== Form Names ======
Created Sunday 07 February 2021

When you submit a form, the **action** attribute determines where the form data will be sent to.

The **name** attribute determines how the server can access that form data. 

**Example:**
	- 'w ww.google.com/search/?q=search_term
	- this says that the form name is **q**
	


You can add a **name attribute** to each input of the form.
