The **label** element denotes that there is a direct connection between some form of input and some piece of text

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

By using the **label** element, we can make it so that not only the checkbox itself is clickable, but hovering over the words and clicking them will also click the checkbox.

In the example above, the **id** attribute in the **input **element is directly associated with the **label** element's **for** attribute.

Only **ONE** element per page should have a given **id**. (**i.e. no more "basketball" id's on the page above**)

**NOTE: **To break up the inputs into more than one line, use **<p>** tags on each **label / input** combination.
