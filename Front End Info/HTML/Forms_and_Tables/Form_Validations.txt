====== Form Validations ======
Created Friday 05 February 2021

Form Validations = things like "Your password must have one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character..."

Form Validations let a user know that what they are typing in is not good enough or incorrect.

These messages are shown using JavaScript.

**When creating a form and asking for input, you can use the "required" attribute to ensure that people have to fill out that question on the form.**

By doing this and clicking the submit button with empty values, the form will not submit and will instead pull up an error message saying "please fill out this form"

If you set the input's **type** attribute to "**email**", and make it required, it will also check for things like missing "@" symbols, etc.

You can also add a **minlength** and **maxlength** attribute to the input tag:

**Min and Max:**
	- used to validate that a number you enter is within a range of numbers


**Patterns:**
	- you can use **Regex** to create patterns to match a password with, i.e. if the password does not fit within the pattern, it will not be valid and the system will give you an error message
