====== Table Sections ======
Created Friday 05 February 2021

To create a table, start with the **table** tag.

Add headers to your table by using the **tr** tag, and then inside of that, using the **th** tag

Create extra rows and populate under each header by using the **tr** tag, and then inside of that, the **td** tag

Create a table header with **thead. Thead** normally goes around the headers. In the picture below, that is the first set of **tr** tags.
