====== The Image Embed Tag img ======
Created Thursday 04 February 2021

An **<img>** tag has no closing tag; only **<img ......lot of other stuff here, continuing on....>**

**Usage Example:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	- So, **<img src="path/to/file/file name.jpg" **
	- **NOTE: **the width part is best to do in CSS
	
	**You can also do the same thing with an image from the web. Right click the image, click "Copy Image Address", then paste that address into your <img> tag.**
	

**The 'alt' attribute:**
	- use the alt attribute for times when someone is using a screenreader, or as a backup in situations where your image does not load.
	**Example:**
		{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
