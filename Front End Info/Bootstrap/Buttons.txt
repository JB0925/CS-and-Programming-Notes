====== Buttons ======
Created Friday 26 February 2021

All Bootstrap buttons involve the class **btn** and then a variation such as **btn-primary** or **btn-danger**, etc.

You can use the **btn btn-type** class on anchor tags, inputs, etc.

There is also a **btn btn-type-primary**, etc., class where you can have a button appear as an outline with the border being the **primary** color or which ever color you choose. **When you hover over them it fills in with color.**

You can change the size with something like **btn btn-lg** to make a large button, etc.

You can make block buttons with **btn btn-block.**

You can make disabled buttons as well.
