====== Responsive Grid System ======
Created Sunday 28 February 2021

Same as the regular grid system, except the fact that we now use names like **sm, lg, xs, md** in addition to numbers.
**NOTE: class="row no-gutters"** will remove any space between any elements in a row.

**NOTE: **The following **col-md-3 col-6** would mean that above the medium breakpoint, this item would take up 3 units of space in the row. Below the medium breakpoint, it would take up 6 units of space in the row.

**Example:**
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				Some text goes here
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				Some other text goes here
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	- In the above example, the **md** class is used as a **breakpoint**. This means that, until the screen size shrinks, the two columns will share 6 units of space. When the screen size shrinks to the **medium (md) breakpoint**, the two columns (and their text) will stack on top of each other.

**Example 2:**
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3">
				Some text goes here
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3">
				Some other text goes here
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3">
				More text
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3">
				Other text
		  </div>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	- In this example, we have **two breakpoints**. When screen size is **extra large**, the four columns will share 3 units of space in the row. As the screen shrinks, when it gets to the **medium** breakpoint, the four columns will share 6 units of space in the row (**two columns stacked on top each other, twice**). 
	- Below the **medium** breakpoint, the **default is xs.** Since neither **s** or **xs** is specified, it will then stack to where all four columns stack on top of each other.
	- If each **xl** was given 4 units of space instead of 3, this would overflow the row, and one column would stack under one other column.
	- **Remember, if the breakpoints are not specified, ALL columns will stack on top of each other.**
	
	- **Rule of Thumb:** As the screen gets bigger, the units get smaller, and vice versa.



**Making Images Responsive:**
	- With the **img** tag, use the class of **img-fluid** to make it responsive
	- Remember to use the **container-row-col** syntax
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<img class="img-fluid"
					   src="https://www.areallyreallylongurl.here.com/picture1"
					   alt="pic1">
			</div>
			<div class="col">
					  <img class="img-fluid"
					   src="https://www.areallyreallylongurl.here.com/picture2"
						alt="pic2">
			</div>
			<div class="col">
					  <img class="img-fluid"
					   src="https://www.areallyreallylongurl.here.com/picture3"
						alt="pic3">
			</div>
		  </div>
	   </div>
	
	- The above example will place three pictures in a row side by side.
	- This example uses **no breakpoints** (**only uses "col" instead of "col-md-6", etc.**)
	- If you give the **col** div a breakpoint, the pictures will respond in the same manner as the text in the above examples.
	- So if the **class="col-xl-4"**, then when the screen is **xl**, the pictures will sit three side by side, taking up four units of space in the row.
	- Once the screen goes below the **xl** breakpoint, if no other breakpoints are specified, the pictures will stack on top of each other.
