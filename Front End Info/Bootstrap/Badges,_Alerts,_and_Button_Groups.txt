====== Badges, Alerts, and Button Groups ======
Created Saturday 27 February 2021

**Badges:**
	- can be used in buttons, spans, etc. 
	- **class="badge badge-primary" ** or some other Bootstrap color
	- **class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"** or any other Bootstrap color...gives a rounded border radius to the badge


**Button Group:**
	- can be used when a user would need to pick one option, i.e. in place of a radio button
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	- removes the margin that would be between the buttons if the **btn-group** was not used
	- radius is only gives to the outside four corners, not to every button


**Alerts:**
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
	- the first is a simple way to make an alert; the second picture shows how to make it dismissable
