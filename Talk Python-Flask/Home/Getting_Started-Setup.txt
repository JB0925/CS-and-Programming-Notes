**The basic file structure:**
	- main directory is **pypi_app**
	- directly inside of it we create **app.py, data(dir), requirements-dev.txt, requirements.txt, static(dir), templates(dir), viewmodels(dir), and view(dir)**
	- directly inside of **static**, we create three more directories (**css, img, **and **js**)


**NOTE:** initialize everything after you've create all of the files, etc., but running **pipenv install flask**, which automatically creates a virtual environment and a Pipfile, which is like what a **requirements.txt** should be.
