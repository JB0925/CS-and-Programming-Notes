====== TreeSet ======
Created Saturday 26 February 2022

A TreeSet is another type of set that implements the Set interface.

It is much slower than the HashSet, but sorts all elements added to it in ascending order.

**Example:**
	TreeSet<String> myTreeSet = new TreeSet<String>();
	
	
Again, all of the methods that are available on the Set interface are also available here.
