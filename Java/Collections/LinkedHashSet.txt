====== LinkedHashSet ======
Created Saturday 26 February 2022

A LinkedHashSet is another type of Set that implements the Set interface. Its biggest difference is that it maintains the order of insertion.
	**Example:**
		LinkedHashSet<String> myLHSet = new LinkedHashSet<String>();
		

**NOTE:** Because it implements the Set interface, all of the same methods as the HashSet still apply.
