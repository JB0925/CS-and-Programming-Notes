Created Wednesday 13 April 2022

**import java.util.function.Function;**

Function<Integer, Integer> add = number -> number + 1;


**NOTES:**

	 1). This method has to be declared in one of two ways:
		- inside of another method
		- with the access modifier **static** in front of it.
		
	 2). To actually run this function and make it work, you'd need to do something similar to the following:
	**System.out.println(add.apply(2));**
		**// 3**
