====== allMatch ======
Created Monday 25 April 2022

The **allMatch** method is the same thing as **all** in Python.

**Example:**

int[] nums = new int[] {2,4,6,8,10};
System.out.println(
	Arrays.stream(nums)
			 .boxed()
			 .allMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0)
);

The above would print **true**, because all numbers inside nums are even.

However, if you changed 8 to 9, you would get **false**, because then one number does not meet the criteria in the predicate.
