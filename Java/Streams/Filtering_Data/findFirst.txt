====== findFirst ======
Created Monday 25 April 2022

The **findFirst** method works similarly to the **indexOf** method for Lists and arrays in other languages.

Essentially, it can be turned into the Streams version of that.

**NOTE:** It is NOT giving you the index of the number, but instead is letting you check to see if it is present in the group.

**Example:**

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,6};
int result = Arrays.stream(nums)
				   .boxed()
				   .filter(n -> n == 3)
				   .findFirst()
				   .orElse(-1);
				
System.out.println(result);
	**// returns 3**
	
However, if we changed it to **.filter(n -> n == 9)**, it would return -1, because 9 is not present in the array.
