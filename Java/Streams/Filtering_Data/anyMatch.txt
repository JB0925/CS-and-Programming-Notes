====== anyMatch ======
Created Monday 25 April 2022

The **anyMatch** method is the same thing as **any** in Python.

**Example:**

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,6};
System.out.println(
	Arrays.stream(nums)
			 .boxed()
			 .anyMatch(n -> n == 18)
);

The above would print **false**, because there is no instance of 18 in nums.

However, if you changed 18 to 5, you would get **true**.
