====== findAny ======
Created Monday 25 April 2022

The **findAny** method is the exact same thing as the **findFirst** method, except for the fact that it doesn't find the first instance of the number. 

In most cases, it is best to use **findFirst**.

See findFirst for an example of how to use findAny.
