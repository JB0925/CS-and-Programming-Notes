====== DropWhile ======
Created Monday 25 April 2022

DropWhile is the Opposite of TakeWhile. 


Both are ways to filter Data.

Remember, TW takes any item that meets the condition in the predicate **until** the condition is found not to be true.


**DropWhile** does the opposite. It **DOES NOT** take anything that meets the condition in the predicate **until** the **first time** that the condition is found to not be true. Once that happens, it takes everything else.


**Example:**

int[] nums = new int[] {2,4,6,8,9,10,12};

int[] newNums = Arrays.stream(nums)
						.boxed()
						.dropWhile(n -> n % 2 == 0)
						.collect(Collectors.toList());
						

**Return Value of Above:**
	// **{9, 10, 12}**
	
Remember, it drops all the ones that meet the condition **UNTIL** the condition is no longer met. Then it takes everything else.
