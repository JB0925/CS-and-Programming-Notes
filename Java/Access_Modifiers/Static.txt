====== Static ======
Created Friday 25 February 2022

Static variables within a class represent variables or methods that are not unique to each instance created with the class; rather they are unique to the class itself.

When working **within** static methods, you **cannot reference or use** non-static methods or variables from outside of the method that **are not static as well**.

However, you can access **static** methods and variables from within **non-static** methods
