====== Top Level of a File ======
Created Thursday 24 February 2022

Only classes, interfaces, and enums can exist at the top level of a file.

**Public:** The object is visible to all classes everywhere, whether they are in the same package or have imported the package containing the public class.

**Package-private:** The object is only available within its own package, and is visible to every class within the same package.
	Package-private is specified by **leaving off ** the "public / private" keyword altogether
