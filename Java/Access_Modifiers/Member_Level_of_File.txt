====== Member Level of File ======
Created Thursday 24 February 2022

**Member Level** refers to being inside of the class itself, so all the fields, methods, etc.

**Public**: At the member level, it means the same thing that it does  at the top level. a public method or field can be accessed by any class, anywhere.

**Package-private:** Same as Top Level. The method is visible to every class within the same package, but **not** to classes in external packages. Specified by **leaving off the access modifier.**

**private:** The method or field is only visible within the class it is declared. It is not visible anywhere else (including subclasses of its class).

**protected:** the object is visible anywhere in its own package (just like package-private), but also in subclasses, **even if** those subclasses are in another package.
