====== Upper Bounds ======
Created Wednesday 23 February 2022

If you create a class with a Generic type, and don't put a bound on it, this could cause a problem at runtime.

**Example:**
	public class Team<T> {
		ArrayList<T> members = new ArrayList<>();

		public addPlayer(T player) {
			this.members.add(player);
			Sout(player.getName());
		}
	}
	
	
	Then, if you tried to add the String "Joe" to the Team...."Joe" isn't going to have a **getName()** method.



**How To Fix It:**
	You can fix it by putting an upper bound on what the type can be, like this:
	
	**public class Team<T extends Player> {**
		**//**
	}
	
	
	This makes it so that only instances that are of or inherited from the Player class can be accepted into the Team.
