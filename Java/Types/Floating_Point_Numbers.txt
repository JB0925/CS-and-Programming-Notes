====== Floating Point Numbers ======
Created Monday 07 February 2022

There are two types that represent floating point numbers:

1). float
	- single precision number
	Range: 1.4E-45, 3.4028235E38

2). double
	- double precision number
	Range: 4.9E-324, 1.7976931348623157E308

**NOTE:** It is good practice to put an "f" after a float, and a "d" after a double to make it clear which what you are using, AND because **double** is the assumed floating point number.

**NOTE:** If you have **float myNum = 5.25**, you will get an error. The JVM assumes that all floating point numbers are **doubles** unless given the "f" at the end.


**Precision** refers to the format and amount of space occupied by the type.

**Single Precision** occupies 32 bits, and has a width of 32.

**Double Precision** occupies 64 bits, and has a width of 64.
