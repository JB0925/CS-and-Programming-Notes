====== User Input ======
Created Thursday 17 February 2022

To get user input from the console, we need to import **java.util.Scanner**

**Example and Explanation of Code:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Java User Input.png}}

1). Instantiate the new Scanner, the way we get user input from the terminal. Pass it the **System.in**.

2). Because the next thing we are doing is prompting the user for an integer, we do a check to make sure it is an integer by running **scanner.hasNextInt();**

3). If **hasNextInt** is true, we take the value from **scanner.nextInt();** and assign it to the variable **int yearOfBirth**
	int yearOfBirth = scanner.nextInt();

4). We then run **scanner.nextLine();** after assigning the int value because, if we don't, it will **skip the execution of the next part,** which is trying to get the user's name.

5). We then print a line asking for the user's name, followed by assigning the **name** variable to **scanner.nextLine();**, and then print out a message.

6). If **hasNextInt** is NOT true, we print a message letting the user know why.
