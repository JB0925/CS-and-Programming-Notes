====== Instantiating an Array ======
Created Monday 14 February 2022

When an array is declared like:
	int[] myArray;
		OR
	int myArray[];
	
it only creates a reference to the array; it does not actually create the array in memory.

**Instantiating an Array:**
	int intArray[];
	intArray = new int[22];
		- this allocates memory to an array
	
	**OR**
	
	int[] intArray = new int[22];
		- same as above
		

**NOTE: **When instantiating an array like above with the word **new**, an int array will be created with 0's, a boolean array will be created with **false**'s, and a reference type array will be created with **null**'s.
