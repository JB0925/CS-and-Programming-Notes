====== Clone an Array ======
Created Monday 14 February 2022

Using the **.clone()** method creates a deep copy of an existing array.

**Example:**

int intArray[] = {1,2,3};

int cloneArray[] = intArray.clone();

**NOTE:** Two **single dimensional arrays** are not considered to be equal, as they do not have the same reference in memory.



**NOTE:** Cloning a 2D array makes a shallow copy,  in that it only creates **one new array, **
and **each subarray** is a reference to the original **subarray**.
