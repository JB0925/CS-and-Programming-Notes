====== Collections ======
Created Saturday 26 February 2022

**Types of Collections Interfaces:**
	- Set
		- also [[SortedSet]] 
	
	- List
	- Queue
	- Deque
	
	- Map
		- also [[SortedMap]] 
		

**What does this mean?**
	- It means that each Class that implements these interfaces will have all of the methods from that interface, so they are often interchangeable. **NOTE:** This only applies to the classes that implement these interfaces on the **same** level. For instance, `TreeSet implements `SortedSet, so you could not replace [[HashSet]] (which implements Set) with `TreeSet.
	
	**NOTE:** That does NOT mean that they are all the same, as we know classes can implement other methods not found in the interface.
