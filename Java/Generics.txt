====== Generics ======
Created Wednesday 23 February 2022

Generics allow us to create classes, interfaces, and methods, that allow us to take types as parameters

For instance, if you were to write:
	`ArrayList myArr = new `ArrayList();
	

This would be considered valid Java and you wouldn't get any errors if you tried to add different types. This could be a bad thing if, say, you are trying to cast the string "Jesse" to an integer.

If you change the above to:
	`ArrayList<Integer> myArr = new `ArrayList<Integer>();
	

You would now get warnings about trying to include the String "Jesse" in the List.
