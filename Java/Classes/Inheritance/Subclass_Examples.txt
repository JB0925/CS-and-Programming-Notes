====== Subclass Examples ======
Created Friday 18 February 2022

The Dog class gets all of the methods and attributes that the Animal class has, but is also allowed to have its own attributes (**legs, teeth**) and methods (**bark()**).

Notice the use of the **super()** call to initialize the constructor from **Animal**.
