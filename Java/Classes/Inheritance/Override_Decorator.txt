====== Override Decorator ======
Created Friday 18 February 2022

You can use the **@Override** decorator to write a more specific implementation of a method from a superclass.

In the subclass below, we override the **eat() **method in the subclass dog.

**Example:**

public class Animal {
	private String name;
	private double weight;
	
	public Animal(String name, double weight) {
		this.name = name;
		this.weight = weight;
	}
	
	public String eat() {
		return "I have to eat food."
	}
}


**// Inheritance**

public class Dog extends Animal {
	private int legs;
	private int teeth;
	
	public Dog(String name, double weight, int legs, int teeth) {
		super(name, weight);
		this.legs = legs;
		this.teeth = teeth;
	}
	
	**@Override **
	public String eat() {
		return "I eat by chewing my food with my " + this.teeth + " teeth."
	}
}
