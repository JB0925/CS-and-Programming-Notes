====== Composition ======
Created Saturday 19 February 2022

Composition refers to the idea of having several classes make up one larger object. These classes typically do not inherit from a Superclass, though there's nothing that says they can't.

**Brief Example:**
	- let's say we were going to program a bedroom
	- You might need: walls, bed, lamp, ceiling
	
	- each of the types below is another class, and not a primitive type
	
public class Bedroom {
	private Wall wall1;
	private Wall wall2;
	private Wall wall3;
	private Wall wall4;
	private Bed bed;
	private Lamp lamp;
	private Ceiling ceiling;
	
	public Bedroom(Wall wall1, ....) {
		this.wall1 = wall1;
		this.wall2 = wall2;
		**// continue with the rest...**
	}
	
	public void makeBed() {
		bed.makeBed();
	}
	
	public Lamp getLamp() {
		return lamp;
	}
}
