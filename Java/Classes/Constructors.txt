Created Friday 18 February 2022

A constructor initializes a new object before it is used.

You can have more than one constructor.

**Example:**

public class Account {
	private int number;
	private double balance;
	private String customerName;
	
	**public Account(int number, double balance, String customerName) {**
		this.number = number;
		this.balance = balance;
		this.customerName = customerName;
	}
}
