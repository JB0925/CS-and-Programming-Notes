====== Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces ======
Created Wednesday 23 February 2022

The biggest difference between an **interface** and an **abstract class**, is that an abstract class is a little more flexible because you can include fields and other methods that a Subclass can inherit.

With an interface, there are only methods that have to be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
