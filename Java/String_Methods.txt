====== String Methods ======
Created Monday 28 February 2022

**NOTE: **Substring and subSequence methods both take at least a starting index, and both can take an ending index as well.

**NOTE: **compareTo method returns an int that tells you whether or not the String comes before or after the other string. For example,
	"hello".compareTo("world");   returns -15. This means that hello starts 15 letters in the alphabet before world.
	**Rules:**
		- if str1 > str2, it returns a postive int
		- if str1 < str2, it returns a negative int
		- if str1 == str2, it returns 0
	**NOTE:** You will need to handle case checking, as it does not consider "hello" to be the same as "Hello".
