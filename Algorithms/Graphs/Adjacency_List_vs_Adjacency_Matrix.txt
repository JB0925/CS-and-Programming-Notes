====== Adjacency List vs Adjacency Matrix ======
Created Friday 06 August 2021

**Adjacency List						Adjacency Matrix**
	- Can take up less space					- Can take up more space in sparse graphs
	in sparse graphs						because you have to hold space (**0's**) for 
													future potential connections
	- Faster to iterate over all					
	edges								- Slower to iterate over all nodes, because 
													there are more "empty" spaces, with 0s 
	- Can be slower to lookup 				present
	a specific edge							
	-									- Can be faster to look up a specific edge
