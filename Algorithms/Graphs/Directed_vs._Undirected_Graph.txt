====== Directed vs. Undirected Graph ======
Created Friday 06 August 2021

**Directed Graph**
	- usually represented with arrows
	- connections are **ONE WAY** by default
	- **Example:**
		- You follow Kevin Durant on Twitter, and see all of his information, but he doesn't necessarily follow you back
		- **You have an EDGE in a DIRECTED GRAPH pointing to KD, but he DOESN'T have one pointing to you**
		- However, KD probably follows **James Harden**, and **James Harden** probably follows KD
		- They have a two way connection because they made a choice to follow each other


**Undirected Graph**
	- **edges** are usually represented by **straight lines**
	- the edges are **TWO WAY** connections by DEFAULT
	- **Example:**
		- You send Joe from college a **Facebook friend request**, and he accepts
		- You are now friends with Joe, **but he is also now friends with you**
		- You will see all of Joe's content on your feed, **and he will see all of yours**
