This algorithm is the same as DFS Preorder Traversal, except that this one start with the **leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree in terms of which nodes are first appended to the list.**

**NOTE: **Notice that the only difference between this and Preorder is the placement of the **data.append(str(node))** line.

Here, it is at the bottom of **traversal.**

In Preorder, it is at the top of **traversal.**

That small change affect how the data is arranged and stored in the **data** array.
