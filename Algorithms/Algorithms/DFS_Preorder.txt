====== DFS Preorder ======
Created Monday 26 July 2021

Again, this version works with a tree.

**Code:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/DFS Preorder Traversal.png}}

**Explanation:**
	- In this function, we define a function inside of the parent function.
	**- It explores the left half of the tree first**
	
	- we initialize an empty array
	
	- we then define our function, **traverse**, which takes the **data** array and a **node**, which at first will be the **root** of our tree
	
	- in **traverse**, we append the node into data
	- we check if there is a left node
		- if so, we call **traverse** on it
	- we do the same thing on the right
	
	- in the outer, parent function, we call traverse on the **data array**, and the **root** we pass in
	- then we return **data, **a list of tree nodes, sorted by left nodes first, then right half nodes second
