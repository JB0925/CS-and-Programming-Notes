Created Thursday 23 September 2021

Sliding Window is typically an array problem where you shift a particular window to find the minimum, maximum, of a **subarray**

When you see those words, "find the **minimum subarray**", or "find the **greatest sum** of a **subarray of size k**", you most likely can use sliding window problems
