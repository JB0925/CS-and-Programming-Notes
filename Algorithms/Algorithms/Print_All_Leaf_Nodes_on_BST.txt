====== Print All Leaf Nodes on BST ======
Created Monday 26 July 2021

**Code:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Print all BST Leaves.png}}

**Explanation:**
	**NOTE:** This only works on a BST.
	
	- if we don't have a root, we just return
	
	- if we hit level two, we know we have a root, so we check to see if the root has **no children**.
		- if it doesn't have children, we print the root's value and , again, just return
	
	if we hit level three, that means the root has either a left node, right node, or both
	
	- we check the left first and, if there is a **root.left**, we make a recursive call to **print_leaves** with **root.left**
	
	- we then make the same check and conditional call on **root.right**
