====== Augmented Binary Search Trees ======
Created Sunday 10 January 2021

**New Requirement:**
	compute **Rank(t): **how many planes are scheduled to land at times <= t
	
	Augment the BST structure:
		{{.\pasted_image.png}}
		you are keeping track of the size of the subtrees, which is what the numbers are for outside of the keys
		so, subtree 43 has a height of 1, because it is the only element in its tree
		subtree 46 has a height of 2 (46, 41)
		subtree 79 has a height of 3 (79,64, 83)
		subtree 49 (root) has a height of 6 (all of the other nodes are under it)
		
		if you insert or delete from the tree, you must change the size numbers
		as you insert, follow the path of the nodes as you would with a regular BST, 
		but for each Node you visit, increase its **size** number by 1
		
		
		**How do we compute Rank(t) from the subtree sizes?**
			1). walk down the tree to find the desired time **t**
			2). as you walk down, add in the nodes that are smaller (+1)
			3). Add in the subtree sizes to the left
			
			**Example:**
				**Rank(79)**
				
				Step 1). Look at the root (49)
							49 < 79, so total += 1
				
				Step 2). Look to the right since 49 < 79 **BUT** also add in the subtree sizes of the nodes to the left, since they all "landed" before **t**
						**To the left of 49 is 46, which has a height of 2, so total += 2**
						**NOTE: **we do not add the Nodes underneath, because they are counted in the height of the Node immediately to the left of 49
									i.e., there are TWO nodes to the left of 49, so the **total += 2 and NOT total += 3**
						
						**To the RIGHT of 49 IS t (79), so total += 1 because Rank(t) wants all planes landing <= t.**
				
				Step 3). Look to the left of **79**, since the nodes to the **RIGHT of 79** would be greater.
						There is **1** node to the left of **79**, so **total += 1**
						
				**After all of this, the total is 5 planes that are landing BEFORE or AT Time 79.**
				
				
			**The bad news:**
				One side of the tree could keep growing and growing, making it **MORE** like a **LIST** and **LESS** like a **BST**
