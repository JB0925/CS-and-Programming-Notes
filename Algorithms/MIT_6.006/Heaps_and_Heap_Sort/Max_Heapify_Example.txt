====== Max Heapify Example ======
Created Thursday 07 January 2021

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**A[2] **does not fit the definition of a max heap, so we need to change that by using Max_heapify()



{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

After the first call to Max_heapify(), **A[2]** is switched with the largest of its children (**A[4])**, but the same problem still exists, so we make a recursive call to Max_heapify(A, 4)



{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

**A[4] **is again switched with the largest of its children and, this time, the max heap requirements are satisfied, so no more calls are made
