====== Selection Sort - Time and Space Complexity ======
Created Thursday 08 October 2020

**Time Complexity in any case(best, average, worst): O(n**2).....**this is because of two FOR loops, one nested inside another

Also, even if the list is already in sorted order (best case scenario), the computer will still cycle through each position in the list, comparing each value to the next.

**Space Complexity in Worst Case Scenario: O(1)**.....this is because it is an in place algorithm, meaning it does not use extra/auxillary memory

Selection sort is a simple algorithm.

Bucket sort, Heap sort, and Quicksort are complicated algorithms.

**Selection Sort doesn't get much use in practical Computer Science applications.**

That said, it is **NOT **useless:
	- good for use on small lists, where you need to save memory in your program
	- often found on job applications or exams
