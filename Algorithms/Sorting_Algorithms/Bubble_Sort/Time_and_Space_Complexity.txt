====== Time and Space Complexity ======
Created Tuesday 13 October 2020

**Bubble Sort – Time Complexity:**
	- Bubble sort has a time complexity score almost always (worst or average case) of O(n**2).
	- The best case score is O(n), but this is misleading because the best case scenario is an already sorted list

	- It’s a very inefficient algorithm due to how long it takes for a small element at the front of a list to “bubble” up toward the back (or vice versa)


**Bubble Sort – Space Complexity:**
	- Bubble sort has a space complexity score of O(1) in the worst case scenario. This is because it is an in-place algorithm, meaning it uses no auxiliary memory.

	- Bubble sort is a little more efficient than selection sort, but still very inefficient overall.
	- It is sometimes called the “generic bad sorting algorithm”.
