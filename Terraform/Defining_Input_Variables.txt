====== Defining Input Variables ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

So far, our configuration files have all used hard coded values. TF configurations can include variables to make your config file more dynamic and flexible.

**1). **Create a file called **variables.tf**, and include a block that defines a new instance_name:

variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Value of the Name tag for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
}


**2). **In **main.tf**, update the **aws_instance** resource block to use the new variable. The **instance_name** variable block will default to its default value, which is **ExampleAppServerInstance**.


resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {   
   ami           = "ami-08d70e59c07c61a3a"   
   instance_type = "t2.micro"

   tags = {    
	  Name = var.instance_name   
   } 
}


**3).** Apply the configuration using **terraform apply.**

**4). **Now, as a learning tool, apply again, this time overriding the default instance_name by passing in **terraform apply -var "instance_name=YetAnotherName"**
