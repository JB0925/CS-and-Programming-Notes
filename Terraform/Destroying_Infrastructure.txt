====== Destroying Infrastructure ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

We have seen how to create and modify an EC2 instance on AWS with Terraform, but how do we destroy it?

**Reasons to Destroy:**
	- you may want to reduce your security exposure
	- you may want to reduce costs
	- you may want to get rid of short-lived environments like build and testing environments

**NOTE:** This command terminates all the resources specified in your TF state. It **does not** destroy resources that are running elsewhere and are not managed by your current TF project.

**NOTE:** You will see **- resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {...**

The minus sign in front means that a resource is being destroyed.

**NOTE:** When you use **terraform destroy**, TF will determine the order in which to destroy the resources. This is done in order to respect dependencies.
