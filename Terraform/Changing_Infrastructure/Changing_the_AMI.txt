====== Changing the AMI ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

The **AMI** is an **Amazon Machine Image**.

The AWS provider knows that it cannot change the AMI of an instance after being created, so TF will destroy the old instance and create a new one.

To apply these changes, run **terraform apply**

Terraform can make some changes in place, but changing the AMI for an EC2 requires Terraform to destroy the old AMI and recreate it using the new one.


**NOTE:** You will see **-/+ resource "aws_instance" "app_server" **


The minus / plus means a resource is being terminated and recreated.
