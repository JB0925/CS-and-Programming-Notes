====== Safety and Idempotence ======
Created Saturday 31 July 2021

**Safety** refers to the idea of an HTTP verb that can have no adverse effects on an application. A GET request is safe because you can make that GET request 10 times, and nothing in a database or on the server will change.

A POST request is NOT safe, because it can alter data that is not meant to be altered. Same goes for PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.


**Idempotence** is the idea that you can use an HTTP verb over and over and get the exact same result each time. A GET request is also **idempotent**, for the same reasons as above.
