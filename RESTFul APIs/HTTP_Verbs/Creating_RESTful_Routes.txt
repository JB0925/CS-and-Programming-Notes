====== Creating RESTful Routes ======
Created Saturday 31 July 2021

**An Example of RESTful routing:**

**GET - `www.baseurl.com/api/snacks	**request all snacks

**GET - www.baseurl.com/api/snacks/id	**request a particular snack

**POST - **www.baseurl.com/api/snacks	also used to create a snack

**PUT / PATCH - **www.baseurl.com/snacks/id	also used to update

**DELETE - **www.baseurl.com/snacks/id	also used to delete a snack


So, the URLs and endpoints themselves are always similar; it's the HTTP methods that change, for the most part.
