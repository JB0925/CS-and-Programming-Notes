====== GET Examples ======
Created Saturday 31 July 2021

In these examples, we are using a Car model.

**Example: Get All Cars:**
	**NOTE: **Remember, **serialize_cars** was created because we can't "jsonify" a SQLAlchemy Car object, so we created a json-like dict of the object instead.

@app.route('/cars')
def get_cars():
	all_cars = Car.query.all()
	all_cars = [serialize_cars(car) for car in all_cars]
	  return jsonify(cars=all_cars)

**The above responds with all of the cars in the db in JSON format.**
