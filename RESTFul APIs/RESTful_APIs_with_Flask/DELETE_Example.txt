====== DELETE Example ======
Created Saturday 31 July 2021

In the DELETE example, we will remove a car from our database:

**Example:**

@app.route('/cars/<id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_car(id):
	car = Car.query.get(id)
	if car:
		db.session.delete(car)
		db.session.commit()
		return jsonify({"car": "deleted"})
	  return jsonify({'car': 'not found'})


**Explanation:**
	1). set up the route with the DELETE method
	2). try to query for the car
	3). If you have the car, delete it and return a JSON response letting the user know it's been deleted.
	
	4). If not, return JSON saying "not found"
