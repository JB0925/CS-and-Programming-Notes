====== PUT and PATCH Example ======
Created Saturday 31 July 2021

Remember, **PUT** updates the **entire** resource.

**PATCH** updates part or several parts of a resource.


Many times, you will want to use **PATCH** because you can't update a primary key, and **PUT **updates the entire resource.

**Example:**
@app.route('/cars/<id>', methods=['PATCH'])
def update_car(id):
	car = Car.query.get(id)
	if car:
		car.make = request.json.get('make', car.make)
		car.model = request.json.get('model', car.model)
		car.price = request.json.get('price', car.price)
		db.session.commit()
		return jsonify(car=serialize_cars(car))
	return jsonify({'car': 'not found'})


**Explanation:**
	1). we create the route, same as the GET by id route, but this time with the PATCH method.
	2). We run a query for the car.
	3) If we find the car:
		- we run **request.json.get** on each field, and set the default to what the car already has. **This is because, in case the user only updates ONE field, the others won't get set to None.**
	
	4). We commit to the database
	5). We return a JSON response of the updated car.
	6). If no car was found, we return a simple JSON response letting the user know.
