====== Serializing DB Model Instances ======
Created Saturday 31 July 2021

You can use **jsonify** on things like, dicts, lists, string, etc., 
but you cannot use it on a SQLAlchemy model object.

To make it compatible, we have to serialize it. This means we have to write a method displaying / describing how we want our model to look, basically turning it into a dict.

**Example:**
	def serialize_dessert(dessert):
		**return {**
			**'id': dessert.id,**
			**'name': dessert.name,**
			**'calories': dessert.calories**
		**}**
