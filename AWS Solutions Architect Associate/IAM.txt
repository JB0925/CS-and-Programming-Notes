When you first log in, you are the **root user**. It is not a good idea to access services, etc., as the **root user** for security reasons.

Instead, click on create user and add a user.

Click on  **custom password**, enter a password, and click **next steps.**


Next you will create a group. Call your group **admin**, and give it the **policy** called **AdministratorAccess. **

Click **create group** and then, in the bottom right, click on **Next:Tags.**


Change the **account alias** in the right hand side dashboard. Make it something readable and memorable. You can use it to sign in later.
