====== AWS Management Console ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

Click **services** in the top left of the navbar to see all of the AWS services.

The search bar is very helpful for finding services and documentation.

The **global** pulldown in the navbar will typically have a list of regions to choose from. In the case of IAM, it will say **global** because it doesn't require a region.


To find which services in which Region:
	- google the **Region table**
	- not every service is available in every region, so you have to check.
