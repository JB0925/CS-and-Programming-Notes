====== AWS Availability Zoes ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

Each region has many availability zones.
	- There are usually 3
	- minimum is 2
	- max is 6
	

Each Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity

They are separate from each other, so that they are isolated from disasters.

They are connected with high bandwidth and low latency networking.
