====== Creating an EC2 Instance ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

We will walk through how to create an EC2 instance from the AWS Dashboard.

First, search **ec2**, and click the result when it comes up.

Next, in the bar on the left, click on **instances** and then, in the top right of the page, click on **Launch Instances.**


**Step 1). Select an AMI**
	- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
	- you have multiple choices here: quickstart, "my ami's", community ami's, etc.
	
	- click on the ami you want to select it and click the **next: instance type** button.


**Step 2). Select an Instance Type**
	- t2.micro is on the free tier
	

**Step 3). Configure Instance Details**
	- scroll to the bottom where it says **User data**. This is where we can enter in the **bootstrap script** which will only run once at time of initial start.
	
	**Example Script:**
	
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > [[/var/www/html/index.html]]


The above will launch a web server on our EC2 instance. You could do the same thing by putting this script in a file and then uploading the file into the **User data** section as well.


**Step 4: Add Storage:**
	- Leave the **Delete on Termination** checkbox checked, as it means that when we terminate our instance, it will also terminate the memory disc.
	
**Step 5: Add Tags:**
	- You can give your instances tags if you wish. Tags, again, are key : value pairs that work much like dictionaries or JS objects.
	
**Step 6: Configure Security Group:**
	- In the lower left, click **Add Rule**, and click **HTTP **and set the Port-Range to 80
	

**Step 7: Review and Launch:**
	- if you don't already have SSH keys, download them and then store them in the **.aws** directory
	
	
**Step 8: Inspect Your Instance:**
	- Click on **Instances** on the left sidebar and it will show you the instances you have running
	- From there, click on the **Instance Id**
	- If you started a web process, copy the **Public IPv4 Address** and open it up in browser. You'll be able to see anything you to see that was specified in the **EC2 User data **bootstrap file
	
	- You can also click **connect** and it will take you to a terminal window associated with the instance
	
	**NOTE: **Any time you stop an instance, then restart it, the **Public IPv4 Address** will change, which means you'll need to copy over the new address to view your web page, etc.
