====== Intro to Security Groups ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS

They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.

Security groups **only** contain **"allow"** rules.

Security group rules can reference by **IP** or by security group

**Security Groups act as a "firewall" on EC2 instances.**
	They regulate:
		- Access to ports
		- Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
		- Control of inbound network
		- Control of outbound network
		

Security Groups can be attached to multiple instances

They are locked down to a region / VPC combination

It lives "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked, the EC2 instance won't see it.

**It's good to maintain ONE separate security group for SSH access.**

If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's most likely a Security Group issue.

If you application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched.

By default, all inbound traffic is **blocked** and all outbound traffic is **allowed.**
