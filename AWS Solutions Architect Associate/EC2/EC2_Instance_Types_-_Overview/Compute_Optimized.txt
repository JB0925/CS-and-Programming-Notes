**Compute Optimized** instance types are great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors, such as:
	- Batch processing workloads
	- Media transcoding
	- High performance Web Servers
	- High performance computing
	- Scientific Modeling & machine learning
	- Dedicated gaming servers
	
**NOTE: **All of the **compute optimized **EC2 instance types have the **"c"** name, such as **c5.4xlarge**, etc.
