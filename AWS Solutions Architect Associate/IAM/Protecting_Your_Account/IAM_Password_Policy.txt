====== IAM Password Policy ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

Strong passwords = higher security for your account

In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
	- set a minimum length
	- require specific character types
		- numbers
		- lowercase letters
	
	- Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
	- Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
	- Prevent password reuse
