====== IAM Security Tools ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

You have two tools you can use as Security tools:

1). IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
	- a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

2). IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
	- Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
	
	- You can use this information to revise your policies.
