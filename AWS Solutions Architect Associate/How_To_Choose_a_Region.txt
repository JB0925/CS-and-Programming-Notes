====== How To Choose a Region ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

There are several different reasons to pick a region:

1). Compliance with government / legal requirements

2). Proximity to customers: reducing lag time / latency

3). Available Services within a Region: new services and features aren't available in every Region

4). Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing range.
