====== Enum Type ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

Enums are numerical values written as words, and the words have some type of meaning.

**Example:**

enum Role { ADMIN, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR }
	- each name gets a numerical value, starting with 0. So **Role.ADMIN = 0, etc.**
	

**Ways You Can Alter The Values:**

enum Role { ADMIN = 5, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR }
	- ADMIN's value becomes 5 instead of 0
	- READ_ONLY is 6
	- AUTHOR is 7
	
**OR**

enum Role { ADMIN = 5, READ_ONLY = 100, AUTHOR = 27 }
	- you can assign a value to each one individually if you want
	
**OR**

enum Role { ADMIN = "ADMIN", READ_ONLY = 100, AUTHOR = "AUTHOR" }
