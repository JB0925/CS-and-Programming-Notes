====== Include ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

The **include** key works the same way as the **exclude** key, except that when you use **include**, anything that you **don't **put in the value array **WILL NOT** get recompiled when you run **tsc** or **tsc -w**

You can also include an entire folder in the **include **array:

**"include":  [**
  **"jsFiles/",**
  **"Component"**
**]**
