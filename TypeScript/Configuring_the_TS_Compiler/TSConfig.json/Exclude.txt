====== Exclude ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

If you want to exclude files from being watched / compiled by the **typescript compiler**, you can include them in an **exclude **key.

This key goes in after all of the commented out code, but before the closing curly bracket.

**NOTE: node_modules** is always excluded as a default setting. However, if you do bring in the **exclude** key, you **have to **exclude **node_modules** manually.

**Example:**

"exclude": [
  "node_modules"   **// important to exclude**
  "myfile.ts",
  "otherFile.ts",
  "*.dev.ts"
]
