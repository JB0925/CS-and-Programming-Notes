====== Recompiling All Files in a Directory On Change ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

For a bigger project, you won't want to recompile every time you make a change in any file.

You also won't want to run **tsc myfile.ts -w** on every file in the directory.

**How to Make the Compiler Watch a Directory:**

1). run **tsc --init **inside of the directory (**two dashes**)

2). run **tsc**, and now every file will be recompiled

3). run **tsc -w** to run "watch mode" on every file in the directory, which means you don't have to type **tsc app.ts**,. etc. again. As soon as you save a file in that directory, it will be recompiled.

**NOTE: with "tsc -w", you can't run the file in the VSCode terminal while in watch mode.**

**You can, however, still run the file via Node from the MacOS terminal.**
