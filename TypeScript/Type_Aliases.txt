====== Type Aliases ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

**Type Aliases** are a way to give a specific type a name, often as a way to shorten what needs to be typed when using a type that will be used more than once.

They are usually declared at the top of the file.

**Example:**

  type Combinable = number | string;
  
  type ConversionOptions = "as-number" | "as-text";


  function combine(
	input1: Combinable,
	input2: Combinable,
	resultConversion: ConversionOptions
  )
