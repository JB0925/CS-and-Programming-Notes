====== The Never Type ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

**Example:**

function generateError(msg: string, code: number): **never** {
  throw { message: msg, errorCode: code };
};


**never** is a type to make it really clear that this function is **never** supposed to return anything. It is similar to **void**, but maybe a little bit more clear.
