====== Unknown Type ======
Created Sunday 12 December 2021

The **unknown** type is similar to the **any** type, but is not as flexible. The **any** type basically disables any type checking from typescript.

**Unknown is like saying: "I don't know what type this variable will be, but I know what I want to do with it..."**

With **unknown**, let's say you have the following scenario:

	let userInput: **unknown**;
	let userName: **string**;

	userInput = 5;
	userInput = "Max";

	**// typescript doesn't yell about the above because the userInput type is "unknown"**

	**userName = userInput;**

	**// typescript will yell about this, because it doesn't want a type "unknown" assigned to a type "string"**


**How to Make It Work:**

	- do a check first:
	
	if (typeof userInput === "string") {
	  userName = userInput;
	};
