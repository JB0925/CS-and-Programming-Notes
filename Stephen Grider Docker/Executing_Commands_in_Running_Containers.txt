====== Executing Commands in Running Containers ======
Created Monday 03 January 2022

We have seen how to do things like:
	**docker create busybox echo hello world**
	

But what if we want to run other commands inside of a running container?

We can run:
	**docker exec -it container_id <command>**
	
	**NOTE:** You can also run **docker run -it image_name <command>**
		- note that with **exec**, you need to get the container id. With **run**, you need the image id or image name.

The **i** flag means means to make it so that the container accepts STDIN.

The **t** flag makes it so that you get output in a nice looking terminal.	

Of course, we would open up a new terminal window to do this.

So, you could do something like:
	**docker exec -it 0f567 cat myfile.py**

And it would print out what we wanted to see.
