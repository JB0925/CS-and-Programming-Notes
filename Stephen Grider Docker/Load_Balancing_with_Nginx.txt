====== Load Balancing with Nginx ======
Created Tuesday 25 January 2022

**Load Balancing:**
	- the idea of having more than one instance of an application running to be able to handle increased traffic.
	
	- we can run multiple instances of a container with the following:
		**docker-compose up -d --scale container_name=2**
	
**With Docker:**
	- We will use **nginx** as a load balancer to route traffic to more than one instance of our app.
	

**Nginx Default.conf:**

server {
	listen 80;

	location /api {
		proxy_set_header X-Rea-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

		proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
		proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
		proxy_pass http://node-app:3000;
		proxy_redirect off;
	}
}
