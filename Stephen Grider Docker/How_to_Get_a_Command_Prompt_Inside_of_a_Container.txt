====== How to Get a Command Prompt Inside of a Container ======
Created Monday 03 January 2022

We have seen how we can use:
	**docker exec -it container_id command**
	
to run a command in a currently running container.

However, we can actually get a command prompt **inside of the container**, if we want to run several commands.

To do this, run:
	**docker exec -it container_id sh**
