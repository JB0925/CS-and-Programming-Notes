====== Avoid Deleting Important Named Volumes ======
Created Sunday 16 January 2022

So you have created your named volume in your **docker-compose.yml** file. This was done in order to persist data in your database. 

However, **we can no longer run "docker-compose down -v"** because this would **delete** all of the data in our database, because it is stored in a volume.

So how do we get rid of unneeded volumes without deleting the named ones that are important to us?

**1). Start your container with docker-compose up -d    Use whatever other flags you need.**

**2)**. In the container, run **docker volume prune**. It will delete any volumes that are not currently being used, which is what we want. It **WILL NOT** delete the **named** ones for our application because they are currently being used.
