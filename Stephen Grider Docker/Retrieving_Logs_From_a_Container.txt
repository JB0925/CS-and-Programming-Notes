====== Retrieving Logs From a Container ======
Created Sunday 02 January 2022

To get logs from a container:

1). **docker create container_name**
	- this spits out an id
	
2). **docker start id_from_previous**
	- spits out another id

3). **docker logs most_recent_id**
	- logs out anything that was printed out when running the container previously
	

**NOTE: **Using **docker logs **does **NOT** restart the container; it just gets the log from the container
