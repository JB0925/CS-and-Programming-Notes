====== Docker-Compose Rebuild Quickly ======
Created Sunday 23 January 2022

**Scenario:** You are running a container / multiple containers. You add new packages, change your code, etc.

To restart with the changes, you'd typically have to do:
	**docker-compose down**
		- wait for containers to stop
	
	**docker-compose up -d --build**
		- rebuild images and run containers
		

**How to Get Around It:**
	simply run **docker-compose up -d --build -V**
	
	- this will recreate the container with the new changes reflected
	
	- it creates **brand new anonymous volumes**, so that the new additions to **node_modules** are reflected
	
**NOTES:**
	- you obviously need to be in detached mode, or a different terminal, to make this work
