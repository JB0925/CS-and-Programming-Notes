====== Rebuilding Containers ======
Created Tuesday 04 January 2022

Say you make a change to your app code. You then start up a container, and the output is the same as what it was previously.

Why?

Remember, an image takes a snapshot of your current code / setup. So, if your updated code doesn't match this snapshot, it won't be seen within the image.

So how can we rebuild our image WITHOUT having to do unnecessary things like reinstall packages, etc.? **NOTE: **If you add a dependency in your code, then you obviously can't skip this step.

To do this, you run the COPY command twice.

Once BEFORE the RUN command, and once AFTER.

**Example:**
	COPY ./package.json ./ 
	RUN npm install
	COPY ./ ./ 
	
**This means that we want to ONLY copy over the package.json at first, and THEN after running npm install, copy over the rest.**

**This also means that "npm install" won't run again UNLESS there was a change made to package.json.**
