====== Manual Image Generation with Docker Commit ======
Created Monday 03 January 2022

**NOTE: **This is not a common practice.

We typically create an image and then run a container from it.

If we want, we can also take a container, and manually generate an image from it.

**Step 1).** Start up a container in interactive mode using **docker run -it image_name sh**

**Step 2).** In a new terminal window, run the commands:
	**docker ps => get id**
	
	**docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' id_from_previous_step**
	
	doing the above will give you an id for a new image
	
	**docker run new_image_id**
	
	This starts up the new image with the default command
