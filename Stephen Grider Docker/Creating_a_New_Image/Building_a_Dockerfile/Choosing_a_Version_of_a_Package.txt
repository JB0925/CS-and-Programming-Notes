====== Choosing a Version of a Package ======
Created Tuesday 04 January 2022

By going to **hub.docker.com**, and clicking **explore**, you can find a specific image that you might need.

For example, say we need **Node.js**, if you need version **17.3**, in your Dockerfile you can write:

FROM node:17.3
