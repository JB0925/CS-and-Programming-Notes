====== Explanation ======
Created Monday 03 January 2022

FROM alpine
	- alpine is the base image
	- this is akin to installing an OS
	- we can use the alpine OS to install and run redis

COPY [[./]] [[./]]
	- Copy any necessary files (like package.json) from the local PWD to the PWD in the container

RUN apk add --update redis
	- an instruction as to what dependency to install
	- this command is one that we can run on alpine, as alpine comes with this package manager preinstalled on it
	- when this command is run, it creates a temporary container so that it can run the command

CMD ["redis-server"]
	- the command to run once all dependencies are installed
	- **NOTE:** If you have a command with two separate words, such as "npm start", you have to use a comma to separate the parts of the command
