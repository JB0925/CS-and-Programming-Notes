====== Specifiying a Workdir ======
Created Tuesday 04 January 2022

In the Dockerfile, it is good practice to use the WORKDIR command. This is because, in your project, you may have a folder name that conflicts with one of the directories in the container. This would overwrite one of those important directories.

**Example:**

FROM node:alpine

**WORKDIR /usr/app**

COPY ./ ./ 
RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "start"]

The WORKDIR command says "store my app inside of the **usr** directory in a directory called **app.**

Then, any path you specify AFTER that is relative to that WORKDIR path. So "./ ./" means "copy everything from my current local path to /usr/app
