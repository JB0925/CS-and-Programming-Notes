====== Common Mistakes ======
Created Tuesday 04 January 2022

**1).** If your base image doesn't have the package manager you need, go to **hub.docker.com** and choose one that does

**2). **Forgetting to copy the files so that the base image knows where they are.
	COPY [[./]] [[./]]
	
	**NOTE: **Do this before the RUN command

**3).** Forgetting to add a WORKDIR
	WORKDIR /usr/app
	
**4). **Forgetting to map the port you want to connect to when running the image:
	docker run -p 5000:5000 myimage:latest
