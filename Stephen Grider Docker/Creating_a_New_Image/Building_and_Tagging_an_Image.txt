====== Building and Tagging an Image ======
Created Monday 03 January 2022

When you build an image, you can give it a name by **tagging** it. 

The convention, when tagging your images, is:

**docker build -t yourDockerID/project_name:latest**

When you go to run the image and create a container, you don't have to add the **:latest** part. You can if you want, but if you leave it off, it will just run the latest version of the image anyway.
