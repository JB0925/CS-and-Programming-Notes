====== Development vs Production ======
Created Sunday 16 January 2022

It is a good idea to have a **docker-compose.dev.yml** file as well as a **docker-compose.prod.yml **file.

Often, your settings in production will be different than they are in development. A basic example would be:

**1). Setting the NODE_ENV** environment variable to **development** or **production**.

**2).** Using **nodemon** in development in order to see changes reflected without having to rebuild the image, whereas in **production**, using **node index.js** so that any changes are NOT immediately reflected before testing, CI, etc.
