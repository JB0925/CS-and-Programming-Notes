====== Restart Usage Scenarios ======
Created Thursday 06 January 2022

How do you know when to pick **restart: always** or **restart: on-failure**, etc?

Think about what you are running. 

If you have created a web API, you'll probably want to keep that up 24 / 7, and use the **restart:always** tag.

On the other hand, if you're using it to process a file, you may only want to restart it on-failure, because that process is probably supposed to exit after successful completion
