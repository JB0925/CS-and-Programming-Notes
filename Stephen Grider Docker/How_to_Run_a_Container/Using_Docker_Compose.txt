====== Using Docker Compose ======
Created Sunday 02 January 2022

**First**, make sure you have a yaml file titled: **docker-compose.yml**

**Next**, after having a **Dockerfile** and a **docker-compose.yml**, you can run:
	**docker-compose up -d --build**
	
	   ONLY NECESSARY FIRST TIME, OR WHEN
	   DEPENDENCIES CHANGE

Following that, you can just run **docker-compose up.**


**NOTE:** To ensure that the container has stopped, it's a good idea to run **docker-compose stop**
