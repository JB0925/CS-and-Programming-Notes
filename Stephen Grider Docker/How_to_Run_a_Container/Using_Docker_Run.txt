====== Using Docker Run ======
Created Sunday 02 January 2022

**First**, make sure you have a **Dockerfile**.

**Next**, if this is your first time running this container, you need to **build and tag** the Docker image:
	**docker build -t image_name:dev .**
	
	DONT FORGET THE PERIOD AT THE END
	

**Next, **again, if it's your first time running this image:
docker run \
	-it \
	--rm \
	-v ${PWD}:/app \
	-v /app/node_modules \
	-p 3001:3000 \
	-e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true \
	**image_name**:dev


**What Those Options Do:**
	-it: Starts the container in **interactive mode**,   which is necessary for React apps
	
	--rm: removes the container and volumes upon exit
	
	-v: mounts the code into the container at **/app**
	
	-p: the first number exposes that port to other users for intercommunication, and the second number exposes that port to the host
	
	-e: enables a polling mechanism so that hot reloading will work
	
**Already Ran This Image?**
	- you can just run **docker run image_name**
