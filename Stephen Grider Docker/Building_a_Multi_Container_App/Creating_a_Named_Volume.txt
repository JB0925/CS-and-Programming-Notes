====== Creating a Named Volume ======
Created Sunday 16 January 2022

For something like a database, when you bring down a container and you run **docker-compose down -v**, you are deleting the volume associated with that container.

This makes it so that the data saved, read, etc., does **NOT** persist once the container is brought down.

To get around this, we can add **volumes** to our service in the **docker-compose.yml** file, **BUT** we should make them **named volumes** so that we don't accidentally delete them.

**Example:**

volumes:
	- **mongo-db:/data/db**
