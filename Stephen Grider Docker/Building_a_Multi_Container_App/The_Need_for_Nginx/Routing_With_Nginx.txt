====== Routing With Nginx ======
Created Tuesday 11 January 2022

We will create a file called **default.conf** to give Nginx a set of routing rules.

	- **default.conf** adds configuration rules to Nginx
	
	- remember, if our route starts with **"/api"**, we will tell Nginx to route it to the server, and anything else will be routed to the client.
	
	- Nginx will learn that the client is listening on **port 3000**, and the **server** on **port 5000**.
	
	- **Nginx will be listening on port 80.**
