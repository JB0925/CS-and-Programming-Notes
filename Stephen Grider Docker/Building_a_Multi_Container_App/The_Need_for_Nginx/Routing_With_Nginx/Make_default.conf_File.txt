====== Make default.conf File ======
Created Wednesday 12 January 2022

1). Create a new directory called **nginx** in the **root** of the project.

2). Put a file in it called **default.conf**

3). **NOTE: **Semicolons are **really important in this file.**

4). **NEXT STEPS:** Create an Nginx container, build a Dockerfile for it, and connect the **default.conf** file to it.


**Example:**

**// there is an "upstream" called "client", and it's found at port 3000.**
upstream client {
  server client:3000;
}
**// there is an upstream called "api", listening on port 5000.**
upstream api {
  server api:5000;
}
**// Nginx server listen on port 80**
server {
  listen 80;
  **// if requests come in to "/", route them to the client**
  location / {
	proxy_pass http://client;
  }

  **// opening up websocket connections in the client**
  location /sockjs-node {
	  proxy_pass http://client;
	  proxy_http_version 1.1;
	  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
  }
  **// if requests come in to "/api", use a regex to cut off "/api" and route the request to the server / api**
  location /api {
	rewrite /api/(.*) /$1 break;
	proxy_pass http://api;
  }
}
