====== Push Changes Into Prod Environment ======
Created Thursday 27 January 2022

**NOTE:** This is suboptimal. You should not be making builds on a production server because it takes away resources and memory. You should do it on another machine.

1). Make changes

2). Push to GitHub

3). Pull changes from GitHub into production environment.

4). Here, there is no Nodemon, so you will have to rebuild containers and update images, etc.
	Option 1). **docker-compose down && docker-compose up ----**takes a bit longer
	
	Option 2). **docker-compose up --build** ----will rebuild the containers by default
	
	Option 3). Even better....**docker-compose up --build --no-deps name_of_service_that_needs_rebuilt**
	
	
	By passing in option three, you don't waste any time rebuilding the other services that do not need to be rebuilt.
	
	The **--no-deps** flag tells docker-compose not to rebuild any dependencies of the service, i.e. if the service has a **depends_on:** flag in the docker-compose file
