====== Force Recreate Flag ======
Created Thursday 27 January 2022

Say you want to rebuild a container, even if no changes were made to your production code.

You can do so with:

**docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --force-recreate --no-deps node-app**

This will rebuild the **node-app** service, even if no changes were made, **and** will **NOT** rebuild any dependencies of the **node-app** service **(depends_on)**.
