====== Better Production Workflow ======
Created Thursday 27 January 2022

1). Build image on dev server

2). Push image to **Dockerhub**

3). Pull the image from **Dockerhub** into our **production server**
	- log in to hub dot docker dot com and click **create repository**
	- Give it a name and make it public
	
	- in prod environment, run **docker login** and provide relevant data
	
	- copy username/repo_name from Dockerhub
      
	- get current image name by running **docker image ls** 

	- in prod server, **rename** the image you want to push by running
		- **docker image tag current_image_name newname**
	
	- push to Dockerhub by running **docker push new_image_name**


4). In **docker-compose.yml, update to:**

version: "3.7"
services:
	node-app:
		build: .
		**image: jbrink0925/node-app**


5). re-run **docker-compose up**
	- this will pull the **jbrink0925/node-app** image and create a container for it in the production app
