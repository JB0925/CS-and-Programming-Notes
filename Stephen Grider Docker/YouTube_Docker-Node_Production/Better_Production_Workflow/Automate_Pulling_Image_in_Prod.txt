====== Automate Pulling Image in Prod ======
Created Friday 28 January 2022

You can automate the process of pulling an image using **docker watchtower**
	 https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/

Docker Watchtower is a container that watches for a specific image on Dockerhub. If it sees that that image has changed, it will automatically pull it.


**Pull the Image and Run the Watchtower Container:**

sudo docker run -d --name watchtower -e WATCHTOWER_TRACE=true -e WATCHTOWER_DEBUG=true -e WATCHTOWER_POLL_I
NTERVAL=50 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower **service_name**
