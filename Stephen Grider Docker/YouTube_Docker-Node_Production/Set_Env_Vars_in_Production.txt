====== Set Env Vars in Production ======
Created Wednesday 26 January 2022

In our docker-compose.dev.yml file, we just laid out our environment variables in the open. 

This is, of course, bad practice.

In our **docker-compose.prod.yml** file, we will keep the **environment** key, but replace the values with **${value}**. 

We can then go into our Ubuntu server and set the environment variables there, and Docker will know to pull the environment variables from the server.

**Old:**
	environment:
		- MONGO_USER=jesse

**New:**
	environment:
		- MONGO_USER=${MONGO_USER}


**On the Ubuntu Server:**
	Two Options:
		1). **export SESSION_SECRET="secret"., etc.**
		
		2). Create a **.env** file on the Ubuntu server and put the variables in there.
			- then, find the **.profile** file in the home directory and write the following:
			
		**set -o allexport; source /home/ubuntu.env; set +o allexport**
		
		If all else fails, just put .env file in .gitignore and put .env file in root directory.
