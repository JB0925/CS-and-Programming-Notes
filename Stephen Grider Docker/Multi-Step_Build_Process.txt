====== Multi-Step Build Process ======
Created Monday 10 January 2022

Here, we are using an Nginx image for our base image to serve up a static html page in production. We still need to install dependencies and build the application using npm, so we use BOTH the **node** base image AND a **nginx** base image.

Inside of this Dockerfile, we will have two blocks of configuration.

When we do that, we get the ability to specify a second base image.

This will be our **production Dockerfile**.

**Example:**

FROM node:16-alpine **as** builder

WORKDIR '/app'

COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .

RUN npm run build


FROM nginx
**COPY --from=builder /app/build /user/share/nginx/html**

The above is saying to copy from the **builder **part above, the directory **/app/build** into **/usr/share/nginx/html**
