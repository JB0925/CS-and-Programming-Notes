====== Building a Multi Container App ======
Created Monday 10 January 2022

In this app, we have a React frontend, an Express backend, and a Worker process.

We are going to create **Dockerfile.dev**'s for each of them.

We are trying to make it so that if a change is made to the code base, that we don't have to rebuild all images.

**Basic Flow:**
	- copy over package.json
	- run **npm install**
	- copy over everything else
	- create a **docker-compose** file that sets up a **volume** to share files amongst each other
	
**Our Directories:**
	- **client**
	- **server**
	- **worker**
