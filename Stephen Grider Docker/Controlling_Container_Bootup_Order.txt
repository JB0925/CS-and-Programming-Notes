====== Controlling Container Bootup Order ======
Created Friday 21 January 2022

One way to control the bootup order of the containers is to use the **depends_on:** key inside of a source.

The **depends_on** key tells the **node-app** container to wait until whatever is in the array to start up first.

**NOTE:** Ultimately, it is up to your **application** to handle which service starts first. You can't rely on Docker to do it for you. **See the function on the next page for an example.**

**Example:**

services:
  node-app:
	build: .
	ports:
	  - "3000:3000"
	environment:
	  - PORT=3000
	**depends_on:**
	**  - mongodb**
  mongodb:
	image: "mongo:latest"
	environment:
	  - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=hahaha
	  - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
	volumes:
	  - mongo-db:/data/db

volumes: 
  mongo-db:
