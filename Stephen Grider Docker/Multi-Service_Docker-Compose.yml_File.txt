====== Multi-Service Docker-Compose.yml File ======
Created Monday 10 January 2022

Under the **services** section, we have two services:
	- web
	- tests

We have given it the **build context** and the Volumes so that it can **see** the node_modules folder, as well as map to the pwd.

When **docker-compose up** is run (after being built), it will run the tests AND the web server process.

There is no way to interact with the test runner, unfortunately.

version: '3'
services:
	web:
		 build:
			 context: .
			 dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
		 ports:
		- "3000:3000"
	   volumes:
		  - /app/node_modules
		  - **.**:/app
	tests:
		build:
		   context: .
		   dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
		   volumes:
			- /app/node_modules
			- **.**:/app
		 command: ["npm", "run", "test"]
