====== Creating a Production Grade Workflow ======
Created Saturday 08 January 2022

A **production grade workflow** is the idea of:
	development -> testing -> deployment

For this, we will:
	- create an app and push it to a github branch called "feature"
	
	- create a PR to merge with master
	
	- run Travis CI to test the code and, if it passes, merge into master
	
	- Travis CI will then test it again and, if it passes, push it into production
	
	- It will be pushed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
	
	- The cycle starts over again
