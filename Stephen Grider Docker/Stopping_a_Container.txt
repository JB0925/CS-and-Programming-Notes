====== Stopping a Container ======
Created Sunday 02 January 2022

Check to see if you have running containers by running **docker ps**

Then, you have two options to stop a container

After running **docker ps**, you will get the container id.

1). **docker stop container_id**
	- allows the container time to stop processes and cleanup
	
2). **docker kill container_id**
	- kills the running container immediately - no running any cleanup or shutting down processes, etc.
