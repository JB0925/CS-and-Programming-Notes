====== Using Compose to Live Update Tests ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

Here, we will add a new **service** to run our tests via docker-compose:

Add a new service, as we did with **tests** below, **does** run both our web application and our tests, but there is no interactivity with our tests. You can't press **a** to run them again, etc. Unfortunately, this is as good as it gets with **docker-compose**.

version: '3'
services:
	web:
		 build:
			 context: .
			 dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
		 ports:
		- "3000:3000"
	   volumes:
		  - /app/node_modules
		  - **.**:/app
	tests:
		build:
		   context: .
		   dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
		   volumes:
			- /app/node_modules
			- **.**:/app
		 command: ["npm", "run", "test"]
