====== Docker Volumes ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

When building an app, if you make a change to the source code, and then refresh the page, you won't see the changes reflected.

If you wanted to see the changes reflected, you'd need to stop the container, rebuild the image, and then re-run the container.

The way around this is to not make an exact snapshot of the files / filesystem, but to use **docker volumes** instead.


When we use **docker volumes**, we are essentially utilizing a **placeholder** or **reference** to our local machine, and give us access to those files in their current state.
