====== Docker-compose WITH Volumes ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

We have already seen how to write a docker-compose.yml file. Here's how we create that file using a **Dockerfile.dev** file AND **volumes.**

**Example:**

version: '3.7'
services: 
	react-app:
		build:
			**context: .**
			**dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev**
		ports:
		  - "3000:3000"
	  **volumes:**
		- /app/node_modules
		- .:/app
		

**NOTES:** Remember, since we deleted the **node_modules** folder, we are telling our **docker-compose.yml** file that we want it to look in the container's **app** directory for the **node_modules** folder.

Also, just like port mapping, we are saying "map our PWD to the app directory within the container.

This makes it so the code will update on the fly without having to rebuild the image every time we make a change.
