====== Multi-Step Build Process Dockerfile ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

Inside of this Dockerfile, we will have two blocks of configuration.

When we do that, we get the ability to specify a second base image.

**Example:**

FROM node:16-alpine **as** builder

WORKDIR '/app'

COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .

RUN npm run build


FROM nginx
**COPY --from=builder /app/build /user/share/nginx/html**

The above is saying to copy from the **builder **part above, the directory **/app/build** into **/usr/share/nginx/html**
