====== Do We Need the Copy CMD ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

In the **docker-compose.yml** file, we are using **docker volumes** to tell our application "hey, sync up locally with the **app** directory in the container." That works well and, so, because of that, do we really need the COPY command in the **Dockerfile.dev**?


The answer is, yes you probaly can get rid of it, but you should leave it in there as a reminder of what should happnen, just in case the **.yml** file isn't present later on.
