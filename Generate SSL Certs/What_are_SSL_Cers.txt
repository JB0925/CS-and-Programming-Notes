====== What are SSL Cers ======
Created Friday 11 March 2022

SSL certs allow for transfer of data over a secure connection.

You can use the Mac's built in openssl library to generate it.

It has two parts:
	- key
	- cert
	
**How to Generate the Key and Cert with RSA:**

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem
	- You will be asked to answer questions regarding your country, state, ciry, organization, email address


**NOTE:** The key is encrypted; the cert is not. It is only base-64 encoded and it can be read in plain text with the following command:

**openssl x509 -in ca-cert.pem -noout -text**
