====== Use CA (Step1) PK ======
Created Friday 11 March 2022

**NOTE:** This is step 3 in the process.

**Command:**

openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -days 60 -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem **-extfile server-ext.cnf**

**NOTE:** Only do the bolded part if you actually created that file.

Next, it will ask you for the password for the encrypted **ca-key.pem** file.

Running this generates a **ca-cert.srl** file, which is the **serial number** that the server needs to authenticate.
