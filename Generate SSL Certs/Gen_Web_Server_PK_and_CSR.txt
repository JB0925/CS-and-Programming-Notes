====== Gen Web Server PK and CSR ======
Created Friday 11 March 2022

CSR = certificate signing request

To generate the server's PK and CSR, the process is almost the same:

openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server-key.pem -out server-cert.pem -subj "C=US/ ST=Virginia/L=Locust Grove/O=None/OU=None/ CN=*.mysite.com/emailAddress=[[jbrink0925@gmail.com"]]

**NOTE: **All of the "**subj"** information needs to be changed to the server's information.

**NOTE: **Add the above to the **gen.sh** file **just below** the key and cert information

After running it, you will again be prompted to enter a password. Then, the new files will generate.
