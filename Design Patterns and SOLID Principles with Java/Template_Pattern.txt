====== Template Pattern ======
Created Friday 22 April 2022

You use the Template Pattern when several classes have similar functionality, but differ from each other slightly.

The idea is to share as much code between them as you can.


**Steps:**
	- Identify the methods, attributes, etc. from each class that are the same, and **encapsulate** them into a **base class**
	
	- Push the specificities into subclasses, which will hook into the steps that the base class exposes
