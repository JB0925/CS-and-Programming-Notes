====== Problems Design Patterns Solve ======
Created Friday 22 April 2022

Some problems that Design Patterns solve include:
	- code duplication
	- code bloat
	- untestable code
	- rigid, brittle design
	- inheritance abuse
	- unmaintainable code
	- untestable code
	

**By Using Design Patterns:**
	- you can reuse patterns to avoid problems
	- you can improve code readability and testability
	- you establish a common vocabulary between developers

**Be Careful:**
	- it is not always appropriate to use design patterns
	- They only solve problems that are noticeable in large scale applications
