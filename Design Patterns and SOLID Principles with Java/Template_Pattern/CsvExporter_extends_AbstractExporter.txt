====== CsvExporter extends AbstractExporter ======
Created Friday 22 April 2022

**Again, we can see that it has its own fields, its own constructor, etc., but uses and implements many methods from the AbstractReporter class.**


public final class CsvExporter extends AbstractExporter {

	private static final String SEPARATOR = ",";

	private final boolean includeHeader;

	public CsvExporter(Report report, PrintStream out, boolean includeHeader) {
		super(report, out);
		this.includeHeader = includeHeader;
	}

	@Override
	protected void handleLabels(PrintStream out, List<String> labels) {
		if (includeHeader) {
			printStrings(out, labels);
		}
	}

	@Override
	protected void handleRecord(PrintStream out, List<String> record, boolean first, boolean last) {
		printStrings(out, record);
	}

	private void printStrings(PrintStream out, List<String> records) {
		out.println(records.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(SEPARATOR)));
	}
}
