====== RETURNING clause ======
Created Thursday 16 September 2021

If you put a **RETURNING** clause in your SQL statement when creating or updating, it will return the data that is in the RETURNING clause for you.

**NOTE:** Don't just SELECT * or RETURNING *; be specific.

**Example:**
	- see last page for more complete reference.
	
	- **INSERT INTO users**
	  (name, type)
	  VALUES(val1, val2)
	  **RETURNING name, type**
