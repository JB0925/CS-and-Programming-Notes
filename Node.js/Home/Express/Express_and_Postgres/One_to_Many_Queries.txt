====== One to Many Queries ======
Created Sunday 19 September 2021

Node-pg is essentially raw SQL, so you have options here:

1). Use a join
2). Make two separate queries and add the results of one of the queries to the object returned from the other.

**NOTE:** The most optimized solution would be to make two queries without async/await wrap them in an array, and call **Promise.all** on them.


**Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/One to Many-Express.js.png}}

**Explained:**
	**userRes**: getting the user info from a query.
	**messagesRes**: getting the messages from a separate table, where the messages have the user's id
	**user**: creating an object to return; taken from the **userRes** query
	**user.messages = messagesRes.rows;** adding the messages to the user object
