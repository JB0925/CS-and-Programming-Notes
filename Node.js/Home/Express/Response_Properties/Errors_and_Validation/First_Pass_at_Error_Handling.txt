====== First Pass at Error Handling ======
Created Friday 10 September 2021

The easiest way to let Express know about an error is just to throw an error:

**Example:**
	app.get('/users/:username', (req, res) => {
		const user = USERS.find(u => u.username === req.params.username);
		
		if (!user) **throw** "Not Found!";
		
		return res.send({user});
	});
	
	
**Issues with doing it this way:**

1). Can't easily see the stack trace.

2). Can't easily attach a status code.
