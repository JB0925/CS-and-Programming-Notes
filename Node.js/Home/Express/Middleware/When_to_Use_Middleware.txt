====== When to Use Middleware ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

You would use middleware when:
	- you want to log information about every request
	
	- you need to add a current user for every request (i.e. **g** in Flask)
	
	- you need to ensure that users are authenticated
	
	- you need to ensure that a user is authorized to access an endpoint.
