====== What does it look like ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

**middleware.js**
	const logger = (req, res, next) => {
		console.log(`Sending ${req.method} request to ${req.path}.`)
		return **next()**;
	}
	

**NOTE:** You need to have **next()** because, if you don't, you won't make it to the next route.

**NOTE2:** In this case, we will never pass args to **next()**
