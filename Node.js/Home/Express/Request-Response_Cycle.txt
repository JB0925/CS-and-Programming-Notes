====== Request-Response Cycle ======
Created Thursday 09 September 2021

Whenever a user makes a request, Express will invoke the **first matching route handler** that it finds until a response is issued.

app.get('/dogs', (req, res) => {
	return res.send("hello");
});


**// this one will never get matched**
app.get('/dogs', (req, res) => {
	return res.send('How are you?');
});
