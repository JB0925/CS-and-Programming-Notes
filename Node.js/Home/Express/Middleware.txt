====== Middleware ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

**Middleware** is code that runs **in the middle of** the request / response cycle.

In Express, middleware are functions that get access to the **req **and **res** objects and can also call the **next** function.

**express.json()** is an example of middleware.
The **404** and **global error** handlers are examples of middleware.

It allows you to separate your code into more logical groupings and provide more robust error handling.
