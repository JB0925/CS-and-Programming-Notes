====== Use Routes in App.js ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

const userRoutes = require("./routes");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
**app.use("/users", userRoutes);**
	- this line puts the prefix **users** before each of our routes, which is why we didn't add it in **routes.js**
