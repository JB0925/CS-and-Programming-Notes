====== Route Parameters ======
Created Friday 10 September 2021

How do we pass in a parameter, such as an id or username, to a route?

**Example:**
	app.get('/cookies/**:language**', (req, res) => {
		res.send('xyz')
	});


By passing in the "**:language**", you are requesting a route parameter, similar to the <language> that is used in Flask.
