====== Parsing the Request Body ======
Created Friday 10 September 2021

You first need to tell Express to parse request bodies for form data or JSON:

**Example:**
	const express = require("express");
	
	const app = express();
	
	**app.use(express.json());**
	**app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));**

**NOTE:** There used to be a widely used module called **body-parser** that was used to parse JSON data from the body. Now, we have **express.json**, so **body-parser** isn't necessary
