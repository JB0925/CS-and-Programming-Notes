====== Using External Middleware ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

Using external middleware is a three step process:
	- install it 
		**npm install morgan**
	
	- require it
		**const morgan = require("morgan");**
	
	- use it
		**app.use(morgan("dev"));**


After doing this with **morgan**, take a look at your terminal and you will see detailed information about the request, etc.
