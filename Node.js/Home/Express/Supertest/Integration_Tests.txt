====== Integration Tests ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

Integration tests help us to:
	- make sure all the parts work together
	- are essential to have along with unit tests
	- are more involved than unit tests


**Supertest:**
	- Supertest is a library for testing Express applications
	- we will use it for integration tests
	
	- Like Unittest in Python, we can use it to make requests against the app in tests
