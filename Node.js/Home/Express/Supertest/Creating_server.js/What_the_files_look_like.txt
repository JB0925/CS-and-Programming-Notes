Here is a snapshot of a fake Cat API, created to get familiar with Supertest and how it all works. Obviously the data, imports, and logic will change, but we will **always** need **server.js**, exporting and importing **app**, and moving **app.listen** into **server.js.**

**TAKEAWAY: **This is pretty much just **jest** testing. You even run the test with **jest**. The big thing that it gives you is a **request client**, which allows you to actually test your routes to ensure they work like you think they should:
	**const res = await request(app).get()**

Obviously, you can also use .post, .patch, etc.
