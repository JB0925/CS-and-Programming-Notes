====== Creating server.js ======
Created Saturday 11 September 2021

Supertest uses a file that we create called **server.js**.

This is because of the app.listen line in the main app. Supertest will not run if the server is running, so we get around it by exporting the main app, and adding the **app.listen()** line in the new **server.js**

- you'll need to import your app
	 **const app = require("./app");**

- to ensure that we don't start the server for **app.js, **we are going to move the **app.listen** listener **into server.js**

- we will also export our app


**How This Looks:**
	app.js
	
	// ...all of the normal stuff, including the router
	
	**module.exports = app;**
	
	
	server.js
	**const app = require("./app");**
	
	**app.listen(3000, () => {**
		console.log("Listening on port 3000.");
	**}**
