====== Route Handlers ======
Created Thursday 09 September 2021

**Route Handlers** are the same as Flask views:

**Example:**
	app.get('/dogs', (request, response) => {
		return response.send('Dogs go bark');
	});


**NOTES: **
	- response.send determines the content type for you
	
	- every handler should have a callback with two params:
		- request (an object that contains information about the request)
		
		- response(contains useful methods for sending a response)
		
		- often referred to as **req** and **res**
