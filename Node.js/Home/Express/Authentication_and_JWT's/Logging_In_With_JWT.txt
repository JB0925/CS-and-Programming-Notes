====== Logging In With JWT ======
Created Thursday 23 September 2021

JWT stands for JSON Web Tokens.

We will use them to handle authentication in our Express API apps.

**Pattern:**
	- make request with username / pw to AJAX login route
	
	- Server authenticates and returns token in JSON
		- this token is encoded and signed with the open standard "JSON Web Token"
	
	- Front-end JS receives the token and stores it in **var** on in **localStorage**
	
	- For every future request, the browser sends the token in the request
		- The server gets the token from the request and validates it.
