====== Verifying the JWT on the Backend ======
Created Friday 24 September 2021


**How to Verify the Token on the Backend:**

The upcoming pattern would likely have to be repeated more than once, as there are often several pages that require authentication.


**Using Middleware to Authenticate:**

In **middleware.js:**
	const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
		try {
			const token = req.body._token;
			const payload = jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY);
			
			req.user = payload;
			return next();
		} catch (err) {
			return next()
		}
	}

**NOTE:** The above stores the user data on the request for later requests.
