====== Authorization Middleware ======
Created Friday 24 September 2021

This middleware requires a user. If no user is found, it throws a 401 error.

const ensureLoggedIn = (req, res, next) => {
	if (!req.user) {
		const err = new ExpressError("Unauthorized", 401);
		return next(err);
	} else {
		return next();
	}
}


**This middleware ensures that the user is an admin:**

**NOTE: **This is a simplified version designed to show how you could write middleware to perform similar functionality.

const ensureAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
	if (!req.user || req.user.username !== "admin") {
		const err = new ExpressError("Unauthorized", 401);
		return next(err);
	} else {
		return next();
	}
}
