====== JSON Web Tokens ======
Created Thursday 23 September 2021

JSON Web Tokens are an open standard and are implemented across most tech stacks, making them easy to use across different services.

JWT's can store any arbitrary payload of info, which are "signed" using a secret key, so they can be validated later.

A JWT is a **string** that has 3 parts:

**Header:** metadata about the token (signing algo used and type of token)

**Payload:** data to be stored in the token(usually an object)
	- will typically have things like the user ID
	- not encrypted; **don't put secret info in it**

**Signature: **version of header and payload, signed with secret key
