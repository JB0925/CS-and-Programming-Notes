====== Fontawesome ======
Created Sunday 26 September 2021

For some reason, fontawesome cdn links do not work when using express...possibly because of using static files in another directory. 

However, via npm you can install a **Fontawesome library:**
	**npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free**


Then, to use this library, in your app.js, write in:

**app.use(express.static('./node_modules/font-awesome/css'));**
