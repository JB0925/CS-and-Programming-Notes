====== Start a Server ======
Created Thursday 09 September 2021

first, **npm install express**

Then:
	const express = require('express');
	
	const app = express();
	
	app.listen(3000, () => {
		console.log("App on port 3000");
	});


**NOTE: **The server is running, but the app will not do anything except respond with 404s.

**NOTE:** **app.listen** should always be at the bottom of the file.
