====== API Validation with JSON Schema ======
Created Wednesday 29 September 2021

**Things to Remember:**
	1). Every time you add a new field to your API, be sure to update your schema.
	
	2). You may want different schemas for **updating** and **creating**, etc.

We can add rich validation to a JSON API with a tool called JSONSchema. 

To play around with it, you can go to jsonschema.net and login with Github. 

A JSON Schema lays out a detailed explanation for every key in our JSON object and the **values** that it is supposed to take in.


If we **npm install jsonschema**, we can add this validation to our API.

Doing so takes out a lot of the manual checks that we would typically have to do to validate data.
