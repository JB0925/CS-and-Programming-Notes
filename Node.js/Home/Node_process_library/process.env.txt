====== process.env ======
Created Monday 06 September 2021

In the Node shell (simply run the command **node** to get there), you can access environment variables by running:

**process.env.myVarHere**


**process.env** is an object, and its keys are the names of environment variables{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/GET and SET process.env - Node.js.png}}

In the example above, the first line, **export SECRET_INFO=abc123** is used to set an environment variable

The second command is just opening the Node REPL.

The third command, **process.SECRET_INFO** allows us to GET the value of the environment variable SECRET_INFO
