====== Reading Files ======
Created Monday 06 September 2021

We read files with **fs.readFile(path, encoding, callback);**

**path** = like in python, it is the path to the file, relative to PWD

**encoding **= how to interpret the file
	- for text files, this is almost always **utf8**
	- for binary files, (such as an image), we just omit this argument

**callback** = a function that takes **error** and **data**


**Example:**
	const fs = require('fs');
	
	fs.readFile('myFile.txt', 'utf8', function(err, data) {
		if (err) {
			console.log(err);
			process.exit(1);
		}
		
		console.log(`file contents: ${data}`);
	});
	
	console.log('reading file...');
	
	// remember, the file wouldn't have been read at the point that the last line runs, because it is async
