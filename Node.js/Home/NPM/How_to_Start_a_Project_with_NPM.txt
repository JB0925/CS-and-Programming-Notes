====== How to Start a Project with NPM ======
Created Monday 06 September 2021

1). cd into the directory you want to start the project

2). run **npm init**
	- this creates **package.json** that has metadata and dependencies
	
	- if you are in a hurry, or just want the defaults, simply type **npm init --yes**
	

**NOTE: **Make sure you commit the **package.json** in Git.
