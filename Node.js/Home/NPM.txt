====== NPM ======
Created Monday 06 September 2021

**NPM** is like pip for Python.

The command line tool, **npm**, comes with Node just like pip comes with Python.

It makes it easy to manage dependencies for a project.

You can register with **npm** to publish open-source or proprietary packages
