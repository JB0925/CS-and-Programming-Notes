====== Before and After Hooks ======
Created Wednesday 08 September 2021

For one time setup / teardown:
	**beforeAll: **run before all tests start **once**
	**afterAll: **run after all tests finish **once**
	
For things that should run before **every** test:
	**beforeEach:** run before **each** test starts
	**afterEach: **run after **each** test finishes
	

**NOTE:** All of these can be put outside of any **describe / test** function, at the beginning of a file.
