====== Organizing Tests ======
Created Wednesday 08 September 2021

Test files should be named **fileName.test.js**

You can place it in the same directory as the JS file that it itests.

You can also put all tests into a **folder **called **"dunder" tests**, where dunder is the Python-esque double underscores on each side of the tests


If you have a **package.json**, you don't need to have additional configuration.

If not, you'll need to create an **empty** "**jest.config.js"** file.
