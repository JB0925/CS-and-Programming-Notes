====== isocalendar ======
Created Thursday 24 September 2020

Datetime objects have an isocalendar attribute:

time = datetime.datetime(2016, 4, 27, 17, 22, 38)

calendar = time.isocalendar()

print(calendar)

**The above will return a 3-tuple (ISO year, ISO week number, ISO week day)**

They can be accessed just like any other tuple.

For example:

	weeks = time.isocalendar()[1]
	print(weeks)
	
	**returns only the number of weeks into the year that the datetime object is in currently. See picture below.**
