findall
findall() is probably the single most powerful function in the re module. Above we used re.search() to find the first match for a pattern. findall() finds *all* the matches and returns them as a list of strings, with each string representing one match.

   ## Suppose we have a text with many email addresses
  str = 'purple alice@google.com, blah monkey bob@abc.com blah dishwasher'

  ## Here re.findall() returns a list of all the found email strings
  emails = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', str) ## ['alice@google.com', 'bob@abc.com']
  for email in emails:
	# do something with each found email string
	print email
