Created Wednesday 29 July 2020

NOTE: This is NOT Python syntax; just how to use regular expressions to search for strings in text.

[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z-]+\.(com|edu|net)

[  ] = character set, pass in characters to search
+ = one or more

So [  ]+ = one or more of the characters in the character set
@ = literal @ symbol, just as you see in the email addresses

. = match any character, so \. = match the period exactly
com = literal, just as you see in the email addresses

putting "." in the opening character set allows you to search for the "."

(  ) = a group, search for a group of literal strings using the "|" 

"|" = or

So (com|edu|net) = would match the end of any of the above addresses.

Adding the 0-9 in the opening character set allows you to search for numbers as well as the "-" symbol

Also, have to add the "-" in the second character set after the @ symbol. **Remember the "." doesn't need to go in because we search for that with "\."**
