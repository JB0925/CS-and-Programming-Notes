====== Map ======
Created Saturday 30 January 2021

**Map is a cool way to apply a function to every member of an iterable individually.**

**Syntax:**
	**map(function, iterable)**
	
**Examples:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	In the example above, we have an **ops** dict, which is made up of methods from the **operator** module
	**op** is the method being asked for by the function's argument
	**map: ** here, we use a lambda function, with **a** being each member of the list, **number** being the number passed into the function, and calling **op(a, number)**, then finally passing in the iterable.
	Don't forget to cast it to a list
	
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	
	here, we use a similar idea, but as a way to add one iterable item to an item in another iterable
	again, we use the ops dict and call it on a tuple of values, **a**, (**op(a[0], a[1])**)
	finally, we use **zip()** on the two lists to combine each consecutive item of the two lists together into a tuple
