====== How to Use the Redirect Stdout Context Manager ======
Created Sunday 25 October 2020

**Explanation of what is happening in the code below with "redirect_stdout", "BuiltInFunctionType", and "StringIO":**

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**0). if not isinstance(builtin, "BuiltinFunctionType"):**
		**raise "ValueError"**
				checking to make sure the "builtin" arg that gets passed in is an instance of the "BuiltinFunctionType" attribute from Types. If it isn't, a "ValueError" gets raised. "BuiltinFunctionType" just means the built in functions such as **min, max, len, pow, etc.**

**1). f = StringIO():**
		The "StringIO" from io creates a file like object which you can read from, write to, etc. Here, we instantiate a blank "StringIO" object.

**2). with redirect_stdout(f):**
		**help(builtin)**
		**return len(f.getvalue())**
		
			The "redirect_stdout" context manager temporarily redirects **sys.stdout** to another file or file-like object.
			Here, that **file or file-like object** is the "**StringIO" object created above with "f".**
			
			So, **with redirect_stdout(f):** literally means, "redirect the sys.stdout to the file-like object we created called "f".
			
			Next, we call help on the builtin function we passed in. 
			
			Finally, we return **len(f.getvalue()) **to get the length of the value/output. 
			
			to read from the object, we could call **f.read()**
			
			to write to the object, we could call **f.write()**
