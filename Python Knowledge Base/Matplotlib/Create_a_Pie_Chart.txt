Same thing with [[StringIO.]] It isn't necessary if you just plan to show the plot.

Almost the same as the linear graph, except we don't use pandas. We pass the data straight into **plt.pie**
**autopct** = a way to format the data as percentage values
**shadow** = adds a small shadow to the pie
