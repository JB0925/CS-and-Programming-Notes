====== Create List of Class Objects ======
Created Sunday 11 October 2020

You can very quickly create a whole list of class objects if you have other lists to use as instance attributes:


**names = [list of names]**
**bites = [list of bites]**

**ninja_list = [Ninja(*ninja) for ninja in zip(names, bites)]**
**print(ninja_list)**

This will create an entire list of class instances quickly, then print them for you to see.
