====== Iterate through two lists at once ======
Created Sunday 27 September 2020

If you need to use the items in one list to perform an operation with the items in another list, use **range():**

**for x in range(len(line_length)):**
**        total = line_length[x] // round(total_time[x])**
**        wps.append(total)**

each item in the **line_length** list needed to be divided by each item in the **total_time** list, and the indexes lined up, so I just used **range(), **then called each item from each list using the index **[x]**.
