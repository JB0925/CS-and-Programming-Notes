====== Strip Characters from Strings in List ======
Created Sunday 26 July 2020

How to strip a newline from a group of words in a file, then append those words to a new list:

	 **for word in words:**
		 **wordlist.append(word.strip('\n')**
	 **return wordlist**

This appends every word in the list of words to the new list and strips off the newline character at the same time.
