**1). **establish the csv file to write to

**2). **try to load the json file and, if it doesn't work, except the "JSONDecodeError", print the exception message, and reraise the exception
	**NOTE:**
		if this was a file, you would have to open the file i.e. with open(file) as f:
																reader = json.loads(f.read())

**3). **Use the **count** variable to only write the dict keys as headers one time

**4). **Iterate through the list of dicts (in this case), write the keys (headers) once (**if count == 0:)** 

**5).** Write the values for each row

**NOTE the use of the csv.DictWriter to easily write a dict to a CSV.**
