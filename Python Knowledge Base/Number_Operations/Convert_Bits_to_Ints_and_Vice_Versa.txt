====== Convert Bits to Ints and Vice Versa ======
Created Wednesday 16 December 2020

Convert an int to bits:
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
		returns **101110		**#the [2:] index takes off a leading "**0b**" from it.
		
Add an amount of leading zeros to the above:
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
		returns:
			{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
	
	**NOTE: **the zfill was needed in an Advent Of Code problem for Day 14 2020, when I had to convert a base 10 number to bits, then compare each digit to a **bitmask** that was 36 digits long. So **zfill** is not necessary, but it was extremely helpful here.


**NOTE:**
	**bin()** takes an **int**, and converts it to a **string**. It takes no other arguments other than the **int**.
	



Convert bits to an int:
	{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
		returns: **46**, which was the original int that we passed to **bin()**...which is what we expected.
