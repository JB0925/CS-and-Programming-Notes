How to strip a newline from a group of words in a file, then append those words to a new list:

	 **for word in words:**
		 **wordlist.append(word.strip('\n')**
	 **return wordlist**

This appends every word in the list of words to the new list and strips off the newline character at the same time.

Sometimes, using .strip() will strip off too many characters. This is because it removes leading and trailing characters. So, to mitigate that, you can use .rstrip() and .lstrip().

**Example:**

**lst = [line.lstrip('<category').rstrip('/category>') for line in r1]**
