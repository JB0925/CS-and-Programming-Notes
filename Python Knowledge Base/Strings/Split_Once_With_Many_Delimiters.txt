**Step by Step:**

**1). **create a list of characters to split by if **separators=None**

**2). **if there aren't separators, check to see if any items from **chars** are in **text** and, if they are....

**3). **loop through the **chars **list and **split** the text by the **char** with a **maxsplit=1**, then **join** it with a random separator
		finally, return the **split text**, split at the random separator
		
**4). ** if **Step 2** is not **True, **just return the text as given, **split by whitespace, with a maxsplit=1**

**5). BUT**, if there are **separators**, perform the same loop that we did above in **Step 3** with the alternate separators, **splitting on the separator and joining by the random character** each time through the loop, and finally **returning the text, split by the random character.**
