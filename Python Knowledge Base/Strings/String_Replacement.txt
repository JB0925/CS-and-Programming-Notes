====== String Replacement ======
Created Wednesday 28 October 2020

if you have a long string of text, and a list of replacements to make within that text, it would make sense to use **re.sub()** to make these replacements. 

**re.sub()** will work, but in a loop, each call to re.sub will get overwritten.



An easier way to make this work is the following:

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

here, self.extra is a list, and self.txt is the text being passed in to clean up. When done this way, it replaces anything that has the list item in it with an empty space, and **does not** write over it.
