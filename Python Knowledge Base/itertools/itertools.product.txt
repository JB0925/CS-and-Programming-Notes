====== itertools.product ======
Created Thursday 17 December 2020

get cartesian products with **itertools.product():**

**Example:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
		returns:
			{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	
	So it returns all variations for the length of the repeat (default = 1), of whatever iterable you pass in
	

**Example in Non-Trivial Code:**
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
	
	here, I take an binary address, and count the number of X's with the **list.count()** method.
	Then, I create a product object of binary digits (**0,1**), and set the **repeat** to the **count **variable
	In the loop, I loop through each product in the list, and, if the **bitaddress** variable is 'X', I assign the **Kth** item of the product object
	to the new_address list.
