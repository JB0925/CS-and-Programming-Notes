**import textwrap**

textwrap is a module that allows you to make larger changes to a piece of text than you might if you were to use strip() or split(), etc.


#code using textwrap that allows you to dedent the first line in a paragraph, then indent all other lines:

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

if you wanted to return instead of print, you'd set **poem[i]** or **poem[i+1]** equal to the print lines
