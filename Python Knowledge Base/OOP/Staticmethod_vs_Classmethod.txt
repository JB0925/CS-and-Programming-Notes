====== Staticmethod vs Classmethod ======

A class method is bound to the class and can change the state of the class.

A static method is also bound to the class, but cannot change the state of the class. 

A static method is more like a utility function.


You can create class variables before you define init. This can be extremely helpful, depending on what you are trying to do. 


You can call @classmethod variables using cls. For example, if I want to call a class variable in a regular method, I need to use **classname.var, **but if I want to use a class variable in an @classmethod, I can just write **cls.var.**


**Hardcoding the Type of a Classmethod:**
	To hard code a classmethod to return the type of the class, instead of "class str", "class int", etc.:
		**return cls(what you are returning here)**
		**Example:**
