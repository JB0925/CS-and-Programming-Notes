====== dataclass decorator ======
Created Friday 07 August 2020

a dataclass first needs to be imported:

	**from dataclasses import dataclass**
	
Then, you need to use the dataclass decorator:

	**@dataclass**
	class Whatever:
	

The dataclass is powerful because it works just like any other class, except it's extremely easy to set up and takes care of the **__init__, __repr__, and __eq__ **methods for the user. From there, you can create new methods within the dataclass and use "**self" **just as you would in a normal class to refer to the class attributes.

Example:

	**@dataclass**
	**class Bite:**
		**number: int**
		**title: str**
		**level: str = 'somestring'**
		
		**def __post_init__(self):**
			**do stuff with class attributes here like title case, capitalize, etc. using self.var**
			

The **__post_init__** method allows you to manipulate class attributes just as you would in any other class, using self.var.
