====== Create DataFrame from List of Dictionaries ======
Created Thursday 08 October 2020

Sometimes, you are trying to create a Data Frame from user entered data, and there may be several items that are all related. One easy way to store all of this so that it very smoothly creates a Pandas Data Frame is to save it as a list of dicts that updates each time "**.append()**" is called. Here is example code:


**update = []**
**    for k, v in inventory.items():**
**        for value in v:**
**            update.append({'Room':k.title(), 'Item':value[0].strip(), 'Amount':int(value[1])})**

**df = pd.Data|Frame(update)**


The code above will create a neatly formatted Data Frame using the dict keys in the list as **Column** or **Series** names.
