====== idxmin and idxmax ======
Created Monday 31 August 2020

I used this to create a dataframe of the min and max values of each group in the data (i.e. 01-01, 01-02, etc.)

**record_lows = record.loc[record.groupby('the_day').Value.idxmin()]**
**record_highs = record.loc[record.groupby('the_day').Value.idxmax()]**

I grouped by the day of the year, then pulled the min and max values for all stations, for all years based on the particular month-day combination.
