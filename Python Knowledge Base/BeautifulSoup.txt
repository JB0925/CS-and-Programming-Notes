Create a [[BeautifulSoup]] object:

soup = BeautifulSoup(text_to_parse, 'html.parser')

Use **var = soup.find(class_='class-name').get_text  **if you are looking for one item
To find several items:

	**data = soup.find_all(True, {'class':['holiday', 'regional', 'publicholiday']})**

The above object allowed me to get the dates and holidays of the year, stuck into three different classes. This made things fast!

From there, you can iterate over it, like this:

	**days = [tag.a.text.strip() for tag in data if tag.a != None]**
**      months = [tag.time.text for tag in data if tag.time != None]**

To use the dot notation, I had to go into the html to find the tags **(a, time)** that were used to store the holidays and dates.
Don't forget to call "**.text**" on them to, to get only the regular text.
