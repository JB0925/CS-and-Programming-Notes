====== Another Argparse Example ======
Created Thursday 28 January 2021

**Below is the parser for a simple calculator class:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**NOTE: The "nargs='+' parameter allows you to pass in a list (such as a list of numbers for a calculator)**


**The function below shows how the parser is used to call the calculator from the command line:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

{{.\pasted_image003.png}}

Essentially, we are calling the parser object we created from the previous function, then using the **parse_args()** method as the arguments gathered from the command line to pass into the calculator.

Next, we pull the arguments out of **vars(args).items()** and perform some more operations.

This file is meant to be run from the command line.
