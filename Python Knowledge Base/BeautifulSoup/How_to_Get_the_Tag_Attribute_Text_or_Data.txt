====== How to Get the Tag Attribute Text or Data ======
Created Sunday 07 February 2021

For example, to get the **href** link from an anchor tag, you cannot just use **a.text**

You need to treat it like a dictionary key, as below:

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

To find out if **amazon.com** was in the **href** attribute of the **<a>** tags I collected, I wrote the conditional **if AMAZON in link['href']**


If that does not work, all of the HTML elements are stored in an **attrs** attribute, that is like a dict. It has a **.values()** attribute as well.
In the example below, I needed to get the **src** url from the **img** element, but they were nested and **tag.img['src']** was not working.
To make this work, I had to cast all of the dict_values to a list and choose the first one:

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
