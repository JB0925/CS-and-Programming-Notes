====== XML Parsing ======
Created Sunday 06 September 2020

Python package called Elementree:

	**import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET**

to parse, the following code works:

root variable below has a 'tag' and an 'attrib'.....tag = the xml tag, attrib, the dictionary of items belonging to each tag

	**root = ET.fromstring(some_xml_string)**
	**for var in root:**
		**print(var.attrib)**
		
to access individual elements in the attrib dictionary, you call them just like a regular dictionary.
	**print(var.attrib['some_key'])**
