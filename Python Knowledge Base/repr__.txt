====== repr ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2020

Have an object that's too long to print out and view? A class repr with the same problem?

Use reprlib.repr to shorten it by replacing the rest with ellipses!

Best thing is that it's a drop in replacement for the standard repr, so no need to change any of your existing code.
