====== difflib.SequenceMatcher ======
Created Wednesday 02 December 2020

One of the things you can do with difflib.SequenceMatcher is to find similar words within a text. Here I took in a set, turned it into a list, and used a double for loop to use "SequenceMatcher to find words that were >= 95% similar.

**Example:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**NOTE: "tag ! = tags[i]		**# don't get the same word as a match


**Example 2:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**NOTE: the use of itertools.product to grab a pair of tags instead of the double for loop.**

**NOTE: the use of the * to call for both items in the pair i.e. args**

**NOTE: the use of the generator**
