Created Tuesday 06 July 2021

If you need to send JSON in a POST request to a route while testing, here's how you do it:

**1).** import json

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Flask Unittest send JSON in POST Request.png}}


**NOTE:** Data must be a dictionary, and then you call **json.dumps()** on it. 
		Also, add **content_type='application/json'**
