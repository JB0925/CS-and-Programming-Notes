====== Adding Bootstrap and Template Inheritance ======
Created Sunday 25 October 2020

**Template Inheritance is like a base template that all of your other templates can work off of.**

**To allow for template inheritance, you have to add BLOCKS to your HTML.**

**Format for a Block:**
	{% block content %}{% endblock %}
	

The above code is saved in a file called "base.html"

**index.html** will now inherit from **base.html**


Now, in the **index.html** file, with everything erased:
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**CAN'T DEFINE THE SAME BLOCK TWICE**

Now, the **base.html** file looks like this:

{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

And the **Flask_App.py** file looks like this:

{{.\pasted_image003.png}}



**What is Bootstrap?:**

	Bootstrap is a CSS-like framework that can be used to style your website.

**Working With Bootstrap:**

1). Copy the CSS tags and paste them as the first items in your <head> section:
{{.\pasted_image004.png}}

{{.\pasted_image005.png}}

2). Copy the Javascript tags and place them as the last items in your <body> section:
{{.\pasted_image006.png}}
{{.\pasted_image007.png}}

3). Search for **navbar** on the Bootstrap website:		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/

4). Find a nav bar style that you like and copy the code into your base file as the first item in the body. (**code too large to show: see base.html)**
