Step 1). create a variable(found_users) to query the database using the "user" variable above.

Step 2). if there are found_users (Truthy), then add the users email to the session with **session['email'] = found_users.email**, so basically adding a new dict key to session and its value is the User object's email address.

Step 3). If there are no found users, create one.
				**usr = Users(user, '')**
				**db.session.add(usr)**
				**db.session.commit()**
				
				
				
**Another Example of Adding an Email value to the User object in the database:**

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

set an "email" var = to the value coming from the form in the html

query the database again for the user

if found_users, then found_users.email attribute = email

always remember to commit to the database
