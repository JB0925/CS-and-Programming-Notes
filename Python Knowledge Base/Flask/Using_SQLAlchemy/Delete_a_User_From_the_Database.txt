Created Thursday 19 November 2020

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

On the logout page, I decided to delete the user's info.

check to see if the user is in the session dict and, if it is, create a user variable

run a query on the Database, filtering by the user, and call "**.delete()**"

always remember to commit to the Database
