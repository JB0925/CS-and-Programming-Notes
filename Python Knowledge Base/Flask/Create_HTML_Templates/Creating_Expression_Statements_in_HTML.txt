====== Creating Expression Statements in HTML ======
Created Saturday 24 October 2020

Inside of your HTML Template, you can pass pseudo Python code as an expression:

{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

**NOTE: **notice the single curly braces per line and the "%" signs, as well as the **{% endif %}** and **{% endfor %} **needed to close the if statement and for loop. 
		Also, no colon after the **range** statement.
		Also, notice the double curly braces around x. If you don't have those, it will just print "x" any time x % 2 == 1


**Pass a List from Flask to HTML:**
