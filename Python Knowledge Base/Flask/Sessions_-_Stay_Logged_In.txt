====== Sessions - Stay Logged In ======
Created Friday 30 October 2020

Sessions are used to pass user information around on a website and make it so that each page gets the user information, rather than the user having to log in each time they go to a new page.

They are built on top of cookies.

**from flask import session**

Step 1):	**create user session data in the login function:**

Step 2):	**In the user function, check to see if the user is in session and, if so, user = session['user']**
			**return the user inbetween h1 html tags**
			**else: redirect the user back to the login page**
