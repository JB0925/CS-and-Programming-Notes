====== Message Flashing ======
Created Saturday 31 October 2020

Message Flashing is showing some kind of information from the previous page when something happens on the GUI. 

**Example:**
	You login and, on the user page, a message comes up "logged in successfully!"
	You logout and, a message pops up "thank you; please visit again soon..."
	

**from flask import flash**

Step 1):

**in Flask, decide which page you want to flash the message on. We will use the logout page:**
	**We use a conditional to only display the message if a user was previously logged in.**

Step 2):     **update the html to print the messages to the screen. We will do this on the login screen, since the logout screen redirects the user to the login screen:**
