====== Send Form Data to Another Page ======
Created Wednesday 30 June 2021

Say one page has a form on it, and you want to send the form's data to another page. Here's how to do it:

**The Form:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Flask Re-Route Form Data.png}}

Notice how the action is set to the **URL the data is supposed to go to. **The method is **POST**.


**The Routes:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Flask Routes.png}}

Notice that **BOTH** routes accept **GET **and **POST** methods.

In this example, the data is sent from a form on the **home** route **TO** the **story **route.

Then we get **request.form, **and pass it into the template.
