====== Outer Joins ======
Created Thursday 22 July 2021

Remember, outer joins will give us everything from the first table, regardless of whether or not there is a match in the second table. (Same as Left Join).

**Example:**
	emps = (db.session.query(Employee, Department)
			.outerjoin(Department).all())


**NOTE: **If you wanted to do a RIGHT JOIN to get all info from Department, regardless of whether there was a match or not in Employee, you'd just put Employee inside of the .join() call.
