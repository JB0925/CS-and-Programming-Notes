====== Through Relationships ======
Created Friday 23 July 2021

These are similar to the other join relationships we saw, but they go **"through"** a join table (typically) and allow you to get information about **one queried object** from **another table**

**Example:**
class Employee(db.Model):   # ...
	**# direct navigation: emp -> project & back**
	projects = db.relationship('Project',
							   **secondary='employees_projects',**
							   **backref='employees**')

	The **secondary** attribute is what allows us to use **employees_projects** as a join or connecting table, and the **backref**, like before, allows us to do things like **emp_instance.projects **and **project_instance.employees**, without ever having to set up the same thing on the projects table.
