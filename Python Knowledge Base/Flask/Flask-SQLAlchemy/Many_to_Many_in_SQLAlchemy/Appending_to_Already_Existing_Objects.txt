====== Appending to Already Existing Objects ======
Created Sunday 25 July 2021

A very useful feature of a SQLAlchemy many to many relationship is the ability to append to an object, which then creates a new record in the **through** table without having to create the objects yourself.

**Examples:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/SQLAlchemy Append via Relationship.png}}

**NOTE: **Notice the **posts** relationship. Calling **mytag.posts** will get me all related post objects via the **join table **called **PostTag.**

Super useful!

Even better, we can add new posts without even having to call db.session...

**Example:**
	mytag = Tag.query.get(1)
	mytag.posts
		-returns a list of Post objects
	mytag.posts.append(Post(title='Hey', content='How are you?',
								created_at=datetime.now(), user_id=7))
	
	**This automatically adds all of the necessary information to the Post and `PostTag table, and is now available any time I query this tag via the ".posts" attribute!**
