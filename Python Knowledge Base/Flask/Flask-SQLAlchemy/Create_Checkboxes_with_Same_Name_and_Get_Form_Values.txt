====== Create Checkboxes with Same Name and Get Form Values ======
Created Saturday 24 July 2021

You can create several form checkbox inputs with the same name attribute.

From there, you can call **request.form.getlist('name_you_gave_it')** to get a list of strings of all of the values that were checked.
