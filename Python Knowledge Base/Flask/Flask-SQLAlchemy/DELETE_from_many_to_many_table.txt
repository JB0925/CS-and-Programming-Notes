====== DELETE from many to many table ======
Created Saturday 24 July 2021

This covers how to delete from an association table with a composite primary key (more than one PK), and more than one foreign key.

First, you should have no relationships on the association table.

Second, add **ondelete="CASCADE"** to the foreign key portion of the column definition.

**Example:**
	- We want to delete a tag, but we can't because of related items in an association table, UNLESS we do the above:
	
	NOTE how both keys in `PostTag have **ondelete="CASCADE"** in them, and there are no relationships defined in `PostTag.
