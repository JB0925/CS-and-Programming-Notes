====== Adding Class Methods ======
Created Saturday 17 July 2021

You can also add class methods if you need to get data from the class in general, and not just a specific instance:

**Example:**

`@classmethod
def get_by_species(cls, species):
	return cls.query.filter_by(species=species).all()


If called, this method would return all pets whose species was equal to the passed in species.


**Another Example:**

`@classmethod
def get_hungry_pets(cls):
	return cls.query.filter(Pet.hunger >= 50).all()
