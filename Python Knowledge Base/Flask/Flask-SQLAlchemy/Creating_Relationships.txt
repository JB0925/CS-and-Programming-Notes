Here, I've created the SQLALchemy model **Post**. **Post** has 5 columns. Then, at the bottom, it has a **relationship**, which is **NOT** a column. It links it to the user and automatically gets all data related to the user that has the same user id as the **user_id** column that is a Foreign Key.

So, if I run a query like **post = Post.query.get(5)**, as in I wanted the POST with the id of 5.

If I then called **post.users**, I would get the information from the user table for the user whom the post belongs to. This is available to us with the foreign key relationship.
