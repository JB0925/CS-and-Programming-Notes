====== Adding Methods to Model Classes ======
Created Saturday 17 July 2021

You can add methods to Model classes to perform simple calculations, return a simple string, etc.

**Example:**

def feed(self, val=20):
	self.hunger -= val
	self.hunger = max(self.hunger, 0)


**NOTE: **Remember, for a method like this that is supposed to update the database, you need to call **db.session.add(instance)** and **db.session.commit()** within the route.
