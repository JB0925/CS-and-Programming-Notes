====== Create HTML Templates ======
Created Saturday 24 October 2020

with all the other flask imports, import **render_template**


**Basic HTML Template:**

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

Instead of typing in a paragraph or message, etc., you can put a variable in double braces (dict brackets), and use the back end (Flask) to pass the information to the front end (HTML)

**Passing from Back End (Flask) to Front End (HTML):**

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**Passing Multiple Args into Flask:**

{{.\pasted_image002.png}}

**And Passing Those Args Into HTML:**

{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
