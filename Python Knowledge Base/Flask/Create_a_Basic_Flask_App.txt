====== Create a Basic Flask App ======
Created Friday 23 October 2020

1). from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for
2). create an instance:
		**app = Flask("__name__", template_folder='template')	#**name without the quotes, template folder= whatever you save template in

**@app.route('/')					**#this is the page route
3). create a home page:
		**def home():**
			**return 'Hello, this is the home page. <h1>HELLO<h1>**


4). **@app.route('/<name>')			#**any time you pass something inbetween the brackets, it will add that as an argument when page routing
	 **def user(name):**
		**return 'Welcome, ' + name**		# so typing http://127.1.1/5000/Jesse will return a page that says "Welcome, Jesse'

**NOTE:** You can have multiple parameters in the brackets...just be sure to add them as parameters in your view function.


5). **@app.route('/admin')**
	 **def admin():**
		 **return redirect(url_for('home'))		**# this means the user doesn't have admin permissions, so it will redirect them to the home page
	

if __name__ == '__main__':
	**app.run(debug=True)				**# debug=True makes it so that you don't have to re-run it every time you make a change
