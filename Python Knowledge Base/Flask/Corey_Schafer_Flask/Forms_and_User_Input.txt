====== Forms and User Input ======
Created Monday 30 November 2020

Instead of creating HTML forms in the HTML template, you can create another file that goes in the directory with the rest of your project files.

Then, use wtforms  to create Python forms that will translate to HTML.

**Code Example:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}	**contains the necessary imports for these forms**


{{.\pasted_image001.png}} **creating various lines on the form; validators are always a**
																						 **list of classes from wtforms. Notice on the Length class that you can specify a range for the string to be in.**
																						**Email = checks to ensure the passed in email is valid.**
																						**DataRequired = ensure that the data is given.**
																						"**EqualTo = will check for equality amongst passwords.**
																						
																						**NOTE: how password and confirm_password uses "PasswordField" instead of "StringField"**
																						
																						**SubmitField" creates a "submit" button at the end of the form.**

{{.\pasted_image002.png}}			    **a login class/form. Uses the email address as username and the password as, well...the password.**
**Notice this time the "BooleanField was used to remember that the user was logged in.**





To use these new forms import them into your app.py file:
**from forms.py import RegistrationForm, [[LoginForm]]**


**NOTE: each form class has a "validate_on_submit()" method. It is a bool that says wether or not the form data was valid.**
