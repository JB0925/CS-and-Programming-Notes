**NOTE: **You don't need **form.**

**WTForms Examples:**
{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**NOTE: render_kw** allows you to put a placeholder in the form's input box. It is NOT part of the **validators**.


**How to render the WTForms info into a template:**

**NOTE**: These are snippets; not entire files.
**NOTE2:** **Be sure to include the form's "csrf_token()" in the HTML if you want to validate the form.**

**NOTES:** the **class_="div forms"** is the CSS class used to style it
						notice the **form.csrf_token()** right below the form declaration
						it is most likely easier to just create an actual HTML button rather than use the '**SubmitField** from WTForms. This is due to styling issues.
