====== Creating Templates and a Base Template ======
Created Saturday 13 February 2021

**Example of a Base Template:**

**The Base Template:**
	- the base template is just a shell that will contain anything you want to persist across pages, as well as have an area for content to be rendered

{{.\pasted_image.png}}

In this example, there is a navbar that I want to persist across all pages
Then, we add the block for content.and close off the block



**Template that inherits from the base template:**

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

Notice the **{% extends 'layout.html' %}** that is used to extend the base template.
Then, notice how the content block is opened at the beginning of the body
The content block is closed at the end of the body, but can be opened and closed anywhere in the HTML

The example below shows how to use the **Login()** form within the template:
{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
