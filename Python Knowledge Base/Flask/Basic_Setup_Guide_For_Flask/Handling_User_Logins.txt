**Step 1:**
	- set up a login_manager using '**LoginManager**
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}

**Step 2:**
	- not directly related to **flask_login** setup, but note the use of '**UserMixin **and **get_id**, which will be used later with the **login_user** method, which is why we include them in the **User** class.

**Step 3:**
	- use your **login_manager** to load a user with '**@login_manager.user_loader **
	- this is where, internally, the **self.get_id** method and the '**UserMixin** class get used in conjunction with **login_user**

**Step 4:**
	- **Basic Login Logic:**

**Explanation:**
	- check to see if the current user (**which pulls from 'UserMixin**) is authenticated
	- if not, create the **login** form
	- if the submitted form is valid, make a query to the database to see if the user is in the database
	- if the user's name is in the data and the hashed password and the raw password match, then login the user
	- **remember** is optional and I used it here because it was a field on my form
