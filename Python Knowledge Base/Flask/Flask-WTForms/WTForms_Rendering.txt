====== WTForms Rendering ======
Created Monday 26 July 2021

WTForms comes with a built in CSRF **(Cross Site Request Forgery)** Token that is a security measure.

Run the following (including first two lines) to prevent **CSRF Token** from being printed inside your form. The CSRF token will still be active; those two words will not be on screen.

This is also how you render the form in a Jinja Template.

**NOTE:** The `**SubmitField** class turns gives a button a label, which is not usually wanted. To keep it from getting rendered, we use the **if** statement under the initial **for** loop. We use **field.label.text** to access the text of the label itself.

**Another option would be to just leave off the `SubmitField and place an HTML button inside the form itself...**
