			**pop/delete the user from the session**
			**redirect the user to the login page**
			
			
Step 2):	**Add functionality to the login page:**
				**in the else: block, check to see if the user is in the session.**
					**if so, redirect them to the user page					# if this is true, it means the user is already logged in**
				**use the login.html page to create the login page**
