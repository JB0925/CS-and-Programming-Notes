====== ChainMap ======
Created Saturday 28 November 2020

[[ChainMap]] is a neat way to combine multiple dictionaries into one object. They are searched in the order they are entered.

In this example, "ChainMap" takes group3 first, group2, second, and group1 last, so it will search group3 first, group2 second, and group1 last.
