====== deque ======
Created Monday 27 July 2020

A deque is a list-like object from the collections module. It is extremely flexible. Below will be a link to the Python standard library page explaining a deque's methods.

Here are some of them:

//create a deque://
	 x = deque()    or x = deque(maxlen=int).....will set the deque to take a maximum amount of items

x.append(11).....will append an item to the right end of the deque

x.appendleft(45)......appends the item to the left end of the deque

x.pop().....pops off the last item on the right side of the deque, allows you to use the item

x.popleft()....pops the item off the left side

x.insert(index, value).....allows you to insert a value at an index of your choice

x.remove(value).....removes one instance of a value

x,count(value)......counts the number of occurrences of a value in the deque

x.extend([3, 9, 12]).....appends multiple items to the right end of the deque

x.extendleft([3, 9, 12]).....appends multiple items to the left end of the deque

x.reverse()....reverses the deque

x.rotate(int value).....rotates the deque a certain number to the right....a negative int will rotate it that number to the left
