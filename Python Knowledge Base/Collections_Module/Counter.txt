====== Counter ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2020

from collections import Counter

var = Counter(lst)

This will return a dictionary with the count of every item in the list or whatever data structure you feed into it. 


**Update method:**

	with Counter(), you can use the .update() method to update a particular value as you are iterating through a loop.
	
	It is similar to a regular dictionary, where you can say **x.setdefault(key, value), x[key] += 1**
	
	When using it with a defaultdict, you can combine several things together. 
	
	**EXAMPLE:**
		characters = defaultdict(Counter)
		
		for row in reader:
			characters[row['Character']].**update**({row['Episode']: len(row['Line'].split())})
			
	**EXAMPLE TWO(without update()):**
		characters = defaultdict(lambda: Counter())
		for row in reader:
			characters[row['Character']][row['Episode']] += len(row['Line'].split())
			
	The code above takes a character and, for every different episode, it adds an episode entry to the Counter. Then, each time through the loop, it adds to the value of **characters[row['Character']][row['Episode']]**
