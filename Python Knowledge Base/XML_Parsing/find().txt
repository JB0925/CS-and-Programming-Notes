====== find() ======
Created Wednesday 09 September 2020

#set up file for parsing:

**import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\**

**with open(xml, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as f:**
		**tree = ET.parse(f)**............#use parse since it's from a file
		**root = tree.getroot()**

	  #iterate through the root using the first branch of the root
	  **for item in root:**
	**            level = item.find('{http://www.worldbank.org}incomeLevel').text
				name = item.find('{http://www.worldbank.org}name').text
				incomes[level].append(name)
	            
	    
		incomes = {k:v for k,v in sorted(incomes.items())}
		return incomes**


to get the information for **item.find**, I had to go another branch further (**for child in item:**) and **print(child.tag) **to see what the names of the tags were for me to use the .find() on the first branch of the tree.
