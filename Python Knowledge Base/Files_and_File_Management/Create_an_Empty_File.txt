====== Create an Empty File ======
Created Thursday 26 November 2020

If a filename does not already exist, you can create an empty version of the file ahead of time:
**import os**

**filename = 'C:/Users/superuser/Bites/Bite_42.py'**

**if not os.path.exists(filename):**
	**with open(filename, 'w'): pass**
	

An alternative as os.mknod(filename), but on Linux or Mac you need to have root permissions.
