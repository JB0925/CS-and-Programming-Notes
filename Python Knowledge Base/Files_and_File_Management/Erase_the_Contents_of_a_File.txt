====== Erase the Contents of a File ======
Created Thursday 26 November 2020

Use **file.truncate(0)** to completely erase the contents of an existing file:

**NOTE: Use 'r+' or 'w+' to ensure you have read and write access to the file.**

In the example below, I created a file that would be overwritten every time new data was added or changes were made, so to avoid duplication, I added each line of the file to a list, then used **file.truncate(0)** to erase the file.

**The code above:**

1). with open....**open the file in read/write mode**

2). create a **reader** object to read in the lines from the file

3). loop through each line and add it to the list of lines

4). truncate/erase the file to add new data without duplications. **The list in line 4** **serves as a sort of "record keeper" that acts to add the lines back later.**
