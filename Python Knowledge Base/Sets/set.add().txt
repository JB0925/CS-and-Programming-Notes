====== set.add() ======
Created Sunday 02 August 2020

set.add is just like list.append(), but for sets instead of lists:

set = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}

set.add(11)

set = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11}

set.add(3)

set = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11}


In the last example, 3 was not added because there is already a 3 in the set.
