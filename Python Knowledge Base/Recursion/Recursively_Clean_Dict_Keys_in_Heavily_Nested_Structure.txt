====== Recursively Clean Dict Keys in Heavily Nested Structure ======
Created Tuesday 05 January 2021

**Depending on the circumstances, some of this might have to change, but the idea is still the same:**
	- call **replace** on what you want to remove
	- check if the values are instances of **dicts** and, if they are, **call the function on the value**
	- check if the values are instances of **lists** and, if they are, **call the function on items in the list**
	- finally, set **new_dict[key] = value**
	- **return**
