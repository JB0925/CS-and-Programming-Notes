====== Entry Widget ======
Created Wednesday 14 October 2020

Entry Widget is the standard Tkinter widget used to enter/display a single line of text. 

**sample code:**
	self.master = master
	master.title('Python')
	master.minsize(height=?, width=?)
	
	name = Entry(master, width=?, borderwidth=?)
	name.grid(**row=0, column=0, columnspan=4, padx=10, pady=10**).....**sets the Entry widget to row 0, column 0.**
	
	
**Anything you want to display in the GUI needs to be called in the "__init__" method.**


**Entry Methods:**

	name = Entry()
	**name.delete(0, END).....**END is a Tkinter attribute signifying the end of the string, 0 is an index.
	**name.insert(0, 'something here')......**again, 0 = index.......'something here' = text to be added
	
	**name.get()**......acts like a clipboard and copies the current text in the Entry widget.


**Have to use .grid() method to add it to screen. See above.**
