====== Union ======
Created Sunday 12 September 2021

**Union** indicates that the type of a variable could be multiple different kinds of types.

**Example:**
	def dispense_snack(user_input: str) -> Union[HotDog, Pretzel]:
	
	**This tells other devs that the return value could be a `HotDog instance or a Pretzel instance.**


**Why Use Union?:**
	- good, clear communication
	- typecheckers are aware of Union and will recognize it
	

**Where is Union Useful?:**
	- handling types that are determined based on user input
	- handling error return types, but with more information (a string or error code)
	- Handling different kinds of user input
	
	- Being able to return different types if needed
	
	- Any case where you may have more than one type of value represented
