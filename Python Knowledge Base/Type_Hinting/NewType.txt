====== NewType ======
Created Sunday 12 September 2021

`**NewType** allows us to create a new type

This is useful is you are working with a class and there are two instances that could happen:

**Example:**
	**from typing import `NewType**
	
	class HotDog:
		
		`ReadyToServeHotDog = `**NewType("ReadyToServeHotDog", `HotDog)**
		
		def dispense_to_customer(hot_dog: `ReadyToServeHotDog):
			# code here
	
	
	**NOTE: **The above code only allows the method **dispense_to_customer** to accept hot dogs of the type **`ReadyToServeHotDog. **This makes it really clear what should be passed into the function.
	
	
	**So How Does One Get a "ReadyToServeHotDog"?**
		consider the following:
			**def prepare_for_serving(hot_dog: `HotDog) -> `ReadyToServeHotDog:**
			
			# here, we can already see that the function takes in a "normal" instance of the hot dog class, but returns the same instance that is of type `**ReadyToServeHotDog.**
			
			assert not hot_dog.is_plated(), "Hot dog should not already be plated."
			
			hot_dog.put_on_plate()
			hot_dog.add_napkins()
			**return `ReadyToServeHotDog(hot_dog)**
			
			# in the last line, we are converting the "normal" instance of **class `HotDog**, into the `**NewType** called `**ReadyToServeHotDog**
			
			# this can also be thought of in the same way as:
				x = "5"
				x = int(x)
				
				**Here, we just casted the string variable "x" to an int. **
				
				#We did the same thing above by changing the type of the "normal" hot dog into the new `ReadyToServeHotDog type.
			
			
			# In addition, this is the ONLY way to convert an instance of `HotDog into an instance of `ReadyToServeHotDog. If a developer wants an RTSHD, they'll need to create it using the method **prepare_for_serving()**


**NOTE:** Python does not have a way to let other developers know that a hot dog passed into **dispense_to_customer** needs to come from **prepare_for_serving()**, so it is a good idea to leave a comment explaining your intent

**Example:**
	**from typing import `NewType**
	# NOTE: Only create `ReadyToServeHotDog using the #"prepare_for_serving" method
