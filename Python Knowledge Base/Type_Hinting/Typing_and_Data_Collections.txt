====== Typing and Data Collections ======
Created Monday 20 September 2021

From here on, collections refers to data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.


**Rule #1:** You should try as best as you can to make these types of collections contain **one** type. Or, for a dictionary, all keys are one type, and all values are one type (could be the same type as the keys, or different).

	List[int], Dict[str, int], etc.
	

**Rule #2:** There will obviously be exceptions to this rule, especially when working with things like JSON data and API calls. For this, you can use `**TypedDict.**

	from typing import `TypedDict

**Example:**
	class Range(`TypedDict):
		min: float
		max: float
		
	class NutritionInformation(`TypedDict):
		value: int
		unit: str
		confidenceRange95Percent: **Range**
		standardDeviation: float
	
	class RecipeNutritionInformation(`TypedDict):
		recipes_used: int
		calories: `**NutritionInformation**
		fat: **NutritionInformation**
		protein: **NutritionInformation **
		carbs: **NutritionInformation **
	
	**nutrition_information: RecipeNutritionInformation = get_nutrition_from_spoonacular(recipe_name)**
	

**NOTES:** Here, the last two lines are setting a variable and making it equal to an API call to the Spoonacular API. **Because this data will be heterogenous**, we have created custom classes that inherit from TypedDict. 
	Before, if a developer wanted to know what **nutrition_information["fat"]** would return, they would have to either print it out, or read through the API docs. 
	
	Now, they can easily see that **nutrition_information["fat"]** will return a **value**, which will be an int, a **unit**, which will be a str, **confidenceRange95Percent**, which will be **Range**, and a **standardDeviation**, which will be a float.
	
	What's **Range**? A developer only has to look above to see that it will have two attributes, **min**, and **max**, both of which are floats.
