====== Where Could You Use NewType ======
Created Sunday 12 September 2021

- separating a normal string from a `**SanitizedString** to catch bugs like a SQL injection. By creating `**SanitizedString**, you are letting other devs know that the ONLY strings that should be passed into your function have been checked, cleaned, and are of the type `**SanitizedString**, which is usually ONLY created in one place.

- giving a user the type of `**LoggedInUser** to distinguish logged in users from non-logged-in users

- tracking certain ID's to be used in other parts of a program. If the ID's aren't of type `**CheckedID**, then we know that they aren't valid and our function, provided that we are using a type checker, won't use them.
