====== Non-Builtin Collections ======
Created Monday 20 September 2021

Non-builtin collections would be things like Stacks, Graphs, etc.

**Two Types of non-builtins:**
	1). Ones that aren't representable by some other by another collection type. For example, you **could** represent a Stack with a simple list, so a Stack would not fit here. A **Graph**, however, would fit. See the next page, **Case 1**, for more on this.
	
	2). Ones that **are **representable by an already exisiting collection type, but you want / need to modify some of its behaviors or characteristics.
