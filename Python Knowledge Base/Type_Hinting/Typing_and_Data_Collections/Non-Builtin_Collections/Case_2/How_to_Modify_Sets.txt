====== How to Modify Sets ======
Created Monday 20 September 2021

We can make modifications to sets using the **AbstractBaseClass , **which are found in **collections.abc**.

Abstract Base Classes are intended to be subclassed, and require the subclass to implement very specific methods.

You can find a list of required methods / functions to implement by going to the docs for collections.abc

For a **set**, you would need to implement three different methods:
	1). dunder contains
		- check for membership (x in mySet)
	
	2). dunder iter
		- make it iterable (for veggie in vegetables:)
	
	3). dunder len
		- get its length


**The really cool part?**
	- Once you define the above methods for **collections.abc.Set, **the other Set methods like **intersection, union, equality, etc. JUST WORK. No further action needed.**
