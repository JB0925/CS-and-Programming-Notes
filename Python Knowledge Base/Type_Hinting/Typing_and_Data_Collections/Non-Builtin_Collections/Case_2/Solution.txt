====== Solution ======
Created Monday 20 September 2021

The Solution? Use types from the Collections module:

**NOTE:** Using any of the following from collections comes with a performance cost, so be careful if working on code where performance is critical.

In this example, instead of subclassing a regular dict, we will subclass the **UserDict **from collections. 

There are also **UserString **and **UserList **in the collections module as well. Use these any time you want to make small changes to a string or list.

**Example of Subclassing the UserDict:**

The beautiful thing here is that the code is the exact same as subclassing a regular dict, so we don't even have to do much that is different. **The difference is, now, the .get() method will work just fine.**

	class NutritionInfo(**UserDict**):
		def __getitem__(self, key):
			try:
				return super().__getitem__(key)
			
			except KeyError:
				pass
			
			for alias in get_aliases(key):
				try:
					return super().__getitem__(alias)
				
				except KeyError:
					pass
			
		   raise KeyError(f"Could not find {key} or any of its aliases.")
