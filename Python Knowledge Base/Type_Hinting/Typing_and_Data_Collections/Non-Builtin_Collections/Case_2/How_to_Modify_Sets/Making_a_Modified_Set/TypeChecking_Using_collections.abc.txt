====== TypeChecking Using collections.abc ======
Created Monday 20 September 2021

**Two Examples:**
	def print_items(items):
		for item in items:
			print(item)
			
	
	# the above works well **if** the collection has an **iter** method.
	
	
	def print_items(items: **collections.abc.iterable**):
		for item in items:
			print(item)
	
	
	# this lets the user know that the **items** are an Abstract Base Class, and have an **iter** method implemented on them, which allows us to iterate over them.
