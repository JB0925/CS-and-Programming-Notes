====== Delete Items From a Dictionary ======
Created Sunday 26 July 2020

Many times, it does not work to loop through a dictionary and try to delete items. This is because the dictionary will change size as it goes through the loop, and it will throw an error.

It is often just easier to create a new dictionary with certain qualifications. You can do this with a dictionary comprehension:

**mydict = { k:v for k,v in mydict.items() if len(v) > var }**

Obviously just an example, but it is an easy way to do it.
