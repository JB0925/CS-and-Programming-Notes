====== Return many items from a Dictionary in a Particular Format ======
Created Thursday 06 August 2020

Sometimes, when you try to return items from a dictionary in a certain format, it will only return one item, even though you know the dictionary is more populated. To get around this:

1). create an empty string
2). loop through the dict, list, etc. and, for every loop, set the empty string += the format from the dictionary **plus a new line.**

This will make it so that each formatted string is returned on its own line.

Example:

	**@classmethod**
	**    def zoo(cls):**
	**        string = ''**
	**        for name, num in Animal.names.items():**
	**            string += '{}. {}\n'.format(num, name.title())**
	**        return string**
