====== Store Functions in Dicts to Call Later ======
Created Saturday 23 January 2021

Here's how you can store a function in a dictionary and then, when the dictionary key is called, you can call the function:

**Storing the functions as dict values:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}


**Calling the functions later with dict.get():**
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	
	notice the parentheses after the .get call. That is the parentheses used to call the function.
