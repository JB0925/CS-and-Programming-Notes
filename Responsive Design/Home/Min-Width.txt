====== Min-Width ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

**min-width** does the opposite of **max-width.**

Min-width says, "no matter what, never let my element get smaller than **{number}px**".

Min-width is generally not used as often, because as screens shrink, we often want our elements to adapt to the screen.

If we set **min-width** and our screen shrinks, we often get side-scrolling.
