====== CSS Units ======
Created Thursday 24 June 2021

**Absolute Units:**
	- Pixels (px): always the same size
	- pt, cm, mm, in, etc.
		- you should not really use these (pt, cm, mm, in) unless you are designing your page for a print style
		


**Percentages:**
	- mainly used for widths
	- relative to their parent (except on height, where it can get weird)
	

**Relative Units:**
	- two types:
		- relative to font-size
			-**em** and **rem**
		- relative to the viewport
			- **vw, vh, **(weird ones: **vmin, vmax**)
