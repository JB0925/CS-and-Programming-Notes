====== Percentages ======
Created Thursday 24 June 2021

Generally, when setting widths, you don't want to use pixels.

Pixels are **absolute units** and will always stay the same.

This will cause side-scrolling as screens shrink, because the units (**px**) are not responsive.


**Setting a width with percentages will automatically make the container adjust to the screen size.**

**NOTE:** When using **percentages**, the percentage value is **always** relative to the element's **parent**.
	- so, **width: 50%;** means that it will always be 50% of the width of the element's parent
	
	- in many cases, the parent's width will be 100% anyway, but that is not always the case
