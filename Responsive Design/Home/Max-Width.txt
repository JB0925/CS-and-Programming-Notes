====== Max-Width ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

**NOTE: **You can put min-width, max-width, and width in any order you like inside of the css selector. They are different values.

**max-width:**
	- used to set the maximum size of something 
	- if the screen gets super large, the element won't continue to grow with it, it will stop growing when the max-width is reached


**Examples:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Max-width Example.png}} {{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/max-width css.png}}

	In this example, the screen is shrunk to the smallest size. Both **.first-container** and **.second-container** have a width of **90%** of their parent (**.container**).
	
	
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/max-width 2.png}}

	Same thing here, they both have a **width** of **90%, **but **both have grown larger to match the screen / container size**
	
	



{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Max-Width final.png}}


On this final, example, we can see that the **image** stopped growing as the page got bigger, but the **.first-container **div is still 90% of the width of its parent.

**This is because we set "img {max-width: 800px;}" on our image.** It will never grow to be bigger than 800px.
