====== Export Package List for a Venv ======
Created Friday 30 October 2020

create a **requirements.txt** file that has the names of all of the packages and dependencies that you are using in the Virtual Environment, so they can recreate the Venv on their own.

To get all of the packages in your Venv:
		**pip freeze**
		
This will pull up a list of all packages and dependencies you are using, and then you can copy them into a **requirements.txt** file.
