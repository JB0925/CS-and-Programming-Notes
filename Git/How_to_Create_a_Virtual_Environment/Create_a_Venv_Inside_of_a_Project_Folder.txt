====== Create a Venv Inside of a Project Folder ======
Created Friday 30 October 2020

1). **mkdir project_name**

2). **python -m venv project_name\venv_name**



**To activate that Virtual Environment:**

	**project_name\venv_name\Scripts\activate.bat**
	

**To install the necessary dependencies in the Virtual Environment:**
	
	**pip install -r requirements.txt				#**file name has to be found in the path leading to the Venv. (Desktop)
	
	
	
	
	
	
**It is common to put your Virtual Environment inside of a project folder, but you DON'T want to put project files inside of a Venv.**


**To save files in the folder, but not in the Venv itself:**
		- **cd project_folder**
		- **create a file and save it in the directory, not the Venv.**
