====== Why Virtual Environments ======
Created Friday 30 October 2020

A virtual environment allows you to create environments for each project and not have the dependencies of one project affect three other projects.

**Example:**
	I am making a website with Django 2.0, but all my other websites are made with Django 1.0. If I upgrade to 2.0, this will break all of the sites I made with 1.0. 
	
	But if each project has its own virtual environment, I can install different Versions of Django based on my needs for that project alone. 
	

**When you create a Virtual Environment, you have to pip install anything you may need in that environment, because what you have pip installed locally does NOT carry over to the Venv.**
