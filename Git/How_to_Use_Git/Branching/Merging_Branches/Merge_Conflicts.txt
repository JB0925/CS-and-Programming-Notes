====== Merge Conflicts ======
Created Wednesday 11 November 2020

Merge Conflicts occur when you are writing and committing code to the Master branch on your side, other people are doing the same on their side on a different branch than you, and the Master branch is getting updated from all different places

Sometimes Git doesn't know what you want to keep, what you want to delete, etc., so it has to be done manually:


**Example:**

git checkout -b quick_test

git status

**#situation where your Master Branch and a side branch both have a line 2 of the same file. How does Git/GitHub know which one to accept?**
