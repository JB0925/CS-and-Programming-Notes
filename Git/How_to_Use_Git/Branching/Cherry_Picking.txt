====== Cherry Picking ======
Created Thursday 29 October 2020

Cherry picking allows you to move commits from one branch to another by **specifying exactly which commits you mean to move.**


Easiest way to do this is to specify a single SHA:
	**git cherry-pick 4a4f4492ded......**
	

The above tells Git to take the changes that happened to 4a4f4492ded, and apply them to the current branch.
