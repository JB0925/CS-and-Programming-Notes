====== Undoing Things in Git (git reset) ======
Created Thursday 12 November 2020

You can undo stages (**git add)** and commits **(git commit)**



to undo a staged file:
	**git reset 			#**will unstage all files listed
				**OR**
	**git reset filename.py	**# will only unstage that file
	
	

to undo a commit:
	**git reset HEAD~1**
			HEAD means "last commit"
			~1 means "go back one commit further than the current HEAD" or "reset so that the HEAD before the current HEAD is the new HEAD"


to undo several commits:
	**git reset --hard SHA goes here**
	
	NOTE: This command will uncommit, but also undo, the work done and the only work that will show is work up to the last commit after the command.
