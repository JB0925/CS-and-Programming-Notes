====== How to Go Back to Old Versions of a File ======
Created Sunday 01 November 2020

To restore a file from its last known commit:
		**git checkout HEAD filename.py**
		

To go back to an older version of the file:
		**git log**
			will show all commits and their SHA numbers
		**git checkout (SHA number here with no parens) filename.py**
			in VSCode, this will automatically update your file to match whatever version it was when it was saved with that SHA number
