====== Git Push ======
Created Monday 09 November 2020

**NOTE: ALWAYS "git pull" first**


to push to an already existing on "GitHub" repo:
	
	**git remote add origin "https://......"**
		sets the remote
	**git remote -v**
		verifies the remote URL
	
	make sure everything is added/committed and up-to-date locally....
	
	**git push origin master (master == branch name)**
	
	

to create a "GitHub" repo from Git:
	
	**create a file locally and cd to it/add it to Git**
		sets up an initial Git commit for the folder
	**go to "GitHub" and start a new repository**
		sets the repo up in "GitHub"
	**copy the "https://...." link from the "GitHub" repo**
		get link that will establish connection
	**git remote add origin https://......**
		adding a connection between Git and the "GitHub" repo
	
	**git remote -v**
		will show any remote repositories connected to the local repo
	**git push origin master**
		pushes all files to the master branch of the destination address
	
	**CAN DO LAST STEP DIFFERENTLY!**
	
	to use **git push** instead of **git push origin master:**
		**git push -u origin master**
			from now on, all you would need to type to push to the "GitHub" repo is **git push**
