====== What NOT to add to a Repo ======
Created Thursday 29 October 2020

First, only put **source files (user created)** into Version Control(Git); never put **generated files(computer generated)** into Version Control

A **generated file **is something the computer creates; usually by processing a source file. 
	**Example:**
			**source file:  **a hello.py file that you create
			**generated file:  **a hello.pyc (Pycache) file that is made by the computer


We don't store generated files for two reasons:
	1). It wastes time and space, and can create conflict if you are generating CPython files and someone else is generating JPython files, etc.
	
	2). They are often larger than the original source files, and take up a lot of space.
			**Git Rule:**
					**Avoid committing large files**
					**Never put confidential info into Git or GitHub...no passwords, API Keys, etc.**
