====== Common Workflow for Using Git ======
Created Friday 27 November 2020

The following is a common workflow that many developers use every day re: Git:

**Step 1 - Create a new Branch and checkout the new branch:**
		git branch new_branch_name
		git checkout new_branch_name

**Step 2 - make changes to your file(s), add to staging area and commit (ALL ON NEW BRANCH; NOT MASTER):**
		git add -A     **OR**     git add filename.py
		git commit -m "updated my file"

**Step 3 - push the new_branch to the remote repository:**
		git push -u origin new_branch_name
		git branch -a	**#confirms the new_branch is in the remote repository**

**Step 4 - merge the new_branch with master:**
		**#checkout master first**
		git checkout master
		git pull
		git branch --merged				**#tells the branches that have been merged so far**
		git merge new_branch_name
		git push

**Step 5 - delete the new_branch:**
		git branch --merged				**#ensures the new_branch is actually merged with master**
		git branch -d new_branch_name
		git branch -a					#**will show that the new_branch is deleted locally, but NOT from the remote repository**
		git push origin --delete new_branch_name		**#removes the branch from the remote repo**
