**Add a New File:**

	first, create a new file
	
	run **git status** again, and it will say there are "untracked files"


**Track a file and make sure it's under version control:**
	git add filename.here					#adds the new file to the staging area
	git status							#says "changes to be committed" and lists the new file that was just added
	
	**NOTE: **you can add more than one file with **git add** at a time
	**Example:**
		git add hello.py myexample.py
