====== Using .gitignore ======
Created Thursday 29 October 2020

Sometimes, Python caches files, such as when you import modules from other places on your computer, and stores this information in Pycache.

To have Git ignore this cache and make it so that it doesn't keep telling you those files are untracked, you can **make a text document called ".gitignore" and save it in the same directory.**

**This is what needs to go in the ".gitignore" file:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

note that you can also add more files to be ignored underneath the "_pycache_" file


Next, add the **".gitignore" **file to the repo, and commit it to the repo:

{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
