====== Working With Remote Repos ======
Created Thursday 29 October 2020

**There are four major Git** **commands that talk to remote repos:**
	- **clone**
	- **fetch**
	- **pull**
	-** push**
	
**Clone:**
	**git clone** is what you use when you have the address of a known repository and you want to make a local copy. 
	Example:
		**git clone long address goes here		**#can go to "Git Hub" and find the address to clone


**Push:**
	**git push** is what you use when you want to upload your changes to a remote repo, such as [[GitHub]]
	


**Pull:**
	opposite of **git push**. **Git pull downloads files from a remote repo and puts them into your local repo.**
