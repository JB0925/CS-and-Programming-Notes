====== Committing Changes ======
Created Thursday 29 October 2020

**When you commit changes, you are telling Git to make a snapshot of this state in the repo.**

To do so, type:
		**git commit -m "your message here"**

Check git status again:
		**on branch master**
		**nothing to commit, working directory clean**
		
		**NOTE**: if you don't enter a message, it will bring you to an editor where you can open a file and add a message above all the "#"'d lines.
				 to get out of that editor, do the following:
										**press Esc several times**
										type **":q!" and press Enter**

**NOTE:**
	**If you have a file you've previously committed, and you make a change, you DO NOT have to "git add" the file again. **
	
	**Instead, you can do "git commit -am "your commit message here"**
	
	**NOTE:	ONLY DO THIS WITH FILES THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED**
