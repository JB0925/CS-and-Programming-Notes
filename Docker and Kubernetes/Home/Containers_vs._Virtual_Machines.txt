====== Containers vs. Virtual Machines ======
Created Monday 08 March 2021

**Containers:**
	- Containers are an **abstraction** at the app layer that packages **code** and **dependencies** together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space.
	

**Virtual Machines (VMs):**
	- VM's are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one ** server** into **many servers**. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries - taking up 10's of GB's of memory. VMs can also be slow to boot.



**Benefits of Containers over VMs:**
	- you can run a container in seconds instead of minutes
	- uses less disk space and less memory because it uses less resources (**no OS**)
	- does not need a full OS
	- Deployment
	- Testing
