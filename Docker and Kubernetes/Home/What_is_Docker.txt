**What is Docker?**
	- Docker is a tool for running applications in an isolated environment.
	- Similar to a Virtual Machine, but faster and doesn't require a lot of memory or an OS to operate
	- Your app runs in the same environment everywhere (if it works on my machine, it works on your machine, etc.)
	- is pretty much the current standard for software deployment
