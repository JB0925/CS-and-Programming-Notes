====== How to Run a Container ======
Created Monday 08 March 2021

**Remember, a CONTAINER is a running INSTANCE of an image.**


**To Run a Container From an Image:**
	- type **docker run [[nginx:latest]]**
	- **syntax = docker run [[REPOSITORY:TAG]]**
	
	- when you type the above in and press ENTER, it will do nothing for quite awhile. It is just waiting.
	-**To ensure that your container is running or at least loading:**
		- in a new terminal, type **docker container ls**
		- look for your instance amongst the short list provided
	
	
	**Many times, typing the above will cause the run/load container process to stall. **
	
	Hit **ctrl + C.**
	Type **docker container ls**
	
	Run **docker run -d [[nginx:latest]]**
		- process is no longer hanging; will give you an ID
		
	Run **docker container ls** again, and you can see that everything is running correctly.
	
	
	
	**BEST WAY TO CHECK TO SEE WHAT CONTAINERS ARE RUNNING:**
		- **docker ps**
