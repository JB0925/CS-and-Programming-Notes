====== Docker Images ======
Created Monday 08 March 2021

An image is a template for creating an environment of your choice (almost anything).

It is a snapshot. You can create more than one, and point to that version in production (kind of like git).

It has everything your apps need to run.
	- includes the OS, Software, and Application Code
	
	
**You download an image, and then run a container from it.**


**How to see what Images you have:**
	- **docker image ls**
