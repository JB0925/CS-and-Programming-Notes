====== Share Volumes Between Containers ======
Created Thursday 11 March 2021

Say you had a container, **website**, that you wanted to share a volume with a new container that you will call **website-copy**

Use the **volumes-from** command: see below

**Start a New Container:**
	- **docker run --name website-copy --volumes-from website -d -p 8081:80 nginx**
		- NOTE: Make sure you don't run it on the same port twice, i.e., if the port for the first container is 8080, the second should be something like 8081
		- after this command, everything that was in **website** should now appear in the new **website-copy** container
