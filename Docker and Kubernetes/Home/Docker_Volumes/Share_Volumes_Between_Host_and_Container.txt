====== Share Volumes Between Host and Container ======
Created Wednesday 10 March 2021

**Inside of whichever directory you choose (maybe [[/home/jesse]]), create a directory (let's call it "website")**

Inside of that subdirectory, create a file called **index.html**

Create the **index.html **file, then open up Docker Desktop.

In Docker, start a **container** and **mount the "website" directory to the container.**


**In the terminal**, cd into the subdirectory "**website**".


Once there, run **docker run --name website -v $(pwd) -d -p 8080:80 nginx **to start the container
	- the **nginx** is totally dependent upon the container name


Then run **docker run --name YOUR_NAME_HERE -v $(path/to/files):info/on/docker/on/where/to share/files:ro -d -p 8080:80 IMAGE NAME HERE**


**Refresh Your localhost and you will be serving your files from Docker.**


This is called **mounting** your files and directories to Docker.


Run **docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME bash **
	- **it = interactive mode**
	- running this command puts you inside of the Docker container
	- inside of the container, if you **ls** into the path where you mounted your files and directories onto the container, you will be able to see your files and materials
	- **You cannot create files inside of the container, as it is a read-only system**
	- To make it so that you can also write files, remove the '**:ro **from your call to run the container as a volume
	- You can also create files inside of the container that will show up in your file system's folders
