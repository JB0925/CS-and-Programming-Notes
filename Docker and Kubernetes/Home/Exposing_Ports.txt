====== Exposing Ports ======
Created Tuesday 09 March 2021

Running **docker ps** will give you information on the port number that the Container is running on.

We want to map that port number to the container, so that If we use the local server, we can type **[[localhost:8080]]    (80 = port the container is running on**) and it will map to the container


**How to map a Container port to local server:**
	- run **docker run -d -p 8080:80 container_name**
	- running the above gives us a new long hash value
	- **NOTE:** The **80** is the container's port, and is subject to change
	
	Doing this on a local server will begin running the web server of the container you chose. 
	


**How to Expose Multiple Ports:**
	- **docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 3000:80 nginx latest**
	
	- running **docker ps** again will show that localhost:3000 maps to port 80 inside of the container, and so does [[localhost:8080]]
