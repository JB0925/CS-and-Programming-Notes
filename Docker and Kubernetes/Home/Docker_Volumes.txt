====== Docker Volumes ======
Created Wednesday 10 March 2021

Docker volumes allows us to share data / files and folders **between host** and **container**, and also **between containers.**


Essentially, whatever you add to the **host (**local machine), it will also show up inside of the **container** when using **Docker Volumes.**


**How to share between Host and Container:**
		- go to **hub.docker.com' **and search for **nginx** (or whatever image you want)
		- find **more info** on your image of choice
				- **docker run --name some_nginx_container -v [[/some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html]] [[:ro]] -d nginx**
				
				Breaking down the above command:
					- **docker run --name some-nginx**: naming the container
					- **-v**: The volumes
					- '/**some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html**: the directory to put content in so that it will get stored in the container
						- **NOTE: **This information is taken directly from **hub.docker.com/_image_name**. The above is the actual directory where the content goes when using an nginx container.
						- **NOTE2:** **some/content** is keywords for the **content** you want to share from your machine to the docker volume. The real values would be the path to your file(s).
					- **[[:ro]]**    read-only
					- -d detached mode
					- **nginx**: name of image
