====== Naming Containers ======
Created Wednesday 10 March 2021

Start a container, then run **docker ps.**

You will see a random name under the **NAMES** column with **docker ps**


**How to Name Your Docker Container:**
		**docker run --name your_name_here -d -p 8080:port_number CONTAINER_INSTANCE**



Go back and run **docker ps** and you should see the running container's information, this time with the name you gave it.

You can now use this name to start and stop containers.
