====== Build an Image From a Dockerfile ======
Created Friday 12 March 2021

If you run **docker image ls**, you will get a list of all associated items with a particular image

The way to build an image from a Dockerfile is **docker build --tag [[website:latest]] .**
	- must specify the **tag (-t **or **--tag)**
	- the "." at the end of the command tells Docker where to find your Dockerfile


**If you run "docker build --tag [[website:latest]] .", it will start building the image**

Run **docker image ls** again, and now you will see another image....the one you just made


Run **docker run --name website -p 8080:80 -d [[website:latest]]**
	- "--name website" - giving your image a name
	- "-p 8080:80" **opening up ports**
	- "-d website:latest": **detatched mode, image_name : tag**
			- returns an image id
