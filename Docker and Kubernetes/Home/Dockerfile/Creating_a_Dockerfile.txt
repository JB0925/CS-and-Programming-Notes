====== Creating a Dockerfile ======
Created Thursday 11 March 2021

So far, we have seen how to use **volumes** to mount onto a container (host to container). 

When we build a custom image, we may not want to mount onto it.
	- Best thing to do instead is to copy all the files
	
	
**Remember, an Image should have everything that your app needs to run:**
	- **OS**
	- **software**
	- **hardware**
	


**How to create a Dockerfile:**
	- make sure you are in the root folder of the project
	- make a file entitled **Dockerfile**
	
	
	You will always use an existing image as your base image, 




**What goes in the Dockerfile?**

**FROM **[[nginx:latest]]
**ADD . [[/path/to/content/from/container/]]   (same as with Volumes)**
