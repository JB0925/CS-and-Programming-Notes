====== State vs. Props ======
Created Wednesday 30 June 2021

State and Props are the two most important concepts in React, after knowing what a Component is.

**Compare and Contrast:**

**State:**
	- is an object
	- is mutable
	- stores changing component data

**Props:**
	- is an object
	- is immutable
	- stores component configuration
	

A common pattern that we will see again and again is a stateful parent component passing down its state values as props to stateless child components.
