====== useEffect 2nd Argument ======
Created Friday 15 October 2021

You can tell React to skip applying an effect if a certain condition is met.

**useEffect**'s second argument is an array, where you place the name of the **dependencies**.


useEffect(() => {
	document.title = `WOW${"!".repeat(count)}`;
}, [count]);

This tells React that you want to apply this affect on **first render**, but also whenever **count** is updated.

React will give you a warning about using this pattern when the effect does depend on props or state, so be judicial in using it.
