====== React Router ======
Created Saturday 07 August 2021

**Server-side Routing:**
	- the "traditional" way of routing
		- clicking an <a> tag sends you to another route
		- server decides what HTML to respond with, whole page refreshes


**Client-side Routing:**
	- the client can determine what content to show and what HTML to render
	
	**What it Does When Using React Router:**
		- it lets us move through different content while changing the URL
		- it lets us use the back and forward buttons
		- it lets us bookmark pages
		- it allows us to make single page applications
	
	**What "Fake" Client Side Routing Doesn't Do:**
		- it doesn't change the URL
		- it disables the forward and back buttons; if you click back it will just refresh the page, not take you to the last component you looked at
		- there is no way to bookmark one of the "pages" on the site; it will treat all bookmarks the same way
