====== Create React App ======
Created Saturday 19 June 2021

**Create React App **is a template, of sorts, that gives you an initial layout to get you started quickly.

It sets it up so that your JS files are run through Babel automatically.

We can also use modern JS features and idioms.

Makes testing and deployment much easier.
