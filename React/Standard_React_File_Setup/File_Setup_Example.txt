====== File Setup Example ======
Created Thursday 10 June 2021

**Here is "index.html":**
	Notice how all of the components are loaded **before** the **index.js** file.
	
	**NOTE:** Super important to include the **type="text/jsx"** line. If it's not there, they won't be recognized.

**Here is index.js with the top-level App component:**

**NOTE: **This is the only place that **ReactDOM.render()** gets used anymore.
