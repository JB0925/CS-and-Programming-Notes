====== The render Object ======
Created Monday 11 October 2021

Tests that use the React Testing Library are able to make use of the **render** object.
			import { **render** } from "@testing-library/react";


You could use **render** for smoke tests:
	test("it renders without crashing", () => {
		**render**(<App />)
	});
	
	
You can also destructure methods out of the **render** object, such as for writing this snapshot test:
	test("it matches the snapshot", () => {
		const **{ asFragment }** = **render**(<App />);
		expect(asFragment()).toMatchSnapshot();
	});
	

**Other Methods You can Destructure From "render":**
	- .getByText()
		- Find first matching element by its text, and throw error if not found
	
	- .queryByText()
		- same as above, but returns **null** if nothing is found
	
	- .getAllByText()
		- same as getByText, but finds **all** matches instead of **first**
	
	- .queryAllByText()
		- same as queryByText, but finds **all** matches instead of **first match**
		
	- .{get,query}ByPlaceholderText()
		- find **first** matching element by placeholder text (**useful for form inputs)**
		
	- .{get,query}AllByPlaceholderText()
		- same as above, but finds **all** matches instead of only **first match**
		
	- .{get,query}ByTestId()
		- Finds **first** matching element by a **data-testid** attribute (can be used if there is no other easy way to grab an element)
	
	- .{get,query}AllByTestId()
		- Same as above, but finds **all** matches instead of only **first match**
