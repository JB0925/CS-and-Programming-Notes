====== Debugging ======
Created Monday 11 October 2021

**render** provides a **debug** method that can be destructured out of it and used to debug tests.

**Example:**
	const { debug } = render(<Counter />);
	**debug();**   // see the structure of the component
	
	fireEvent.click(getByText("Add"));
	**debug();**   // see how the structure has changed


**Debugging Tests:**
	To set break points, edit your package.JSON:
	
	"scripts": {
		// ...keep other things and add this
		"test:debug": "react-scripts --inspect-brk test --runInBand"
	};
	
	
	**Next**, add the **debug()** line in the test or component you want to test
	**Finally**, run **npm run test:debug** and you will be able to use the Chrome debugger to inspect.
	
	**Visit** chrome://inspect to debug in Chrome.
