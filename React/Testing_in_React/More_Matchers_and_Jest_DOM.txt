====== More Matchers and Jest DOM ======
Created Monday 11 October 2021

Create-React-App comes with a setup file that extends that matching capabilities of Jest.

This is called Jest-DOM.

**Helpful Jest-DOM Matchers:**
	.toHaveClass()
		Check whether an element has a certain class
	.toBeInTheDocument()
		Check whether an element is in the document
	.toContainHTML()
		Check whether the element contains a certain HTML string
	.toBeEmpty()
		Check whether the element has any content
	.toHaveTextContent(content here);
		- checks whether the text of an element contains what is passed in
	
	**NOTE: **All of these examples also work with the **.not** matcher from Jest as well.


**Example Usage:**
	const { getByText } = render(<Counter />);
	  const h2 = getByText("Current count: 0");
	expect(h2).toBeInTheDocument();
	expect(h2).toHaveTextContent("Current");
	
	Here, we selected an **h2** in the **Counter** component, using the **getByText **method from **render**.
	
	Then, we called two Jest-DOM matchers in the **expect** calls.
