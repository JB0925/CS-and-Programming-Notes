====== useAxios - example ======
Created Sunday 17 October 2021

**NOTE:** useAxios is combined in this example with useLocalStorage from the previous example.

**Explanation: **This was a multipurpose example. We will skip the useLocalStorage part. First, we set the url depending on the name parameter given to **addCard. **Then, we make a call to Axios. We create a **newCard** using one of our **formatCard** helper functions, and then we set state. Finally, we have a remove cards method which is used to return state to the starting status.
