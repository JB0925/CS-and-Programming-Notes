====== useRef ======
Created Saturday 16 October 2021

**useRef** works like a global variable, but it is not. 

It works similarly to Flask's **g**.

It returns a **mutable object **whose lone key is **current.**

The value of current is set to whatever is passed into the initial call to **useRef.**

That value can also be updated.

**NOTE: **Changing the value of this object does not change state.


**Where Would We Use useRef:**
	- to access an underlying DOM element
	- to set up or clear out timers, intervals, etc.
