====== React Redux ======
Created Friday 29 October 2021

React Redux is a good tool for managing state and passing state around to multiple smaller components, similarly to useContext.

**How to Use It:**
	To start include the Redux script in a plain HTML file:
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/redux"></script>
		
	
	Next, create a store:
		**const initialState = { count: 0 };**
		**const store = Redux.createStore(initialState);**
		
	**NOTE: **The **store** must be passed a **reducer** function.


**Reducer Functions:**
	A reducer function accepts two object:
		- a state
		- an action
	
	The action is used to prodcue and return new state.
	
	**NOTE:** The reducer should always use **pure** functions like map, filter, etc., in the action section.
	
	**NOTE 2: createStore** must take an initial state upon instantiation.
