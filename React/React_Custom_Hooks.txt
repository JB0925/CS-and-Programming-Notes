====== React Custom Hooks ======
Created Saturday 16 October 2021

You can make your own hooks to:
	- abstract logic
	- handle repeated tasks
	- generate your own JSX
	

**Examples:**
	- we often have to toggle some aspects of state
		- this could be hiding or showing a modal, or moving something from one place to another
