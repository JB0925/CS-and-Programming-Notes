====== Memoize the Context Value ======
Created Tuesday 04 January 2022

When using useContext, any time some aspect of the state changes, even if it doesn't affect a particular component, **every component that subscribes to the context is re-rendered, even if they are wrapped in a call to React.memo.**

We can cut down on this by wrapping the value passed into the Context Provider in a call to React.useMemo.

**Example:**

function AppProvider({children}) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(appReducer, {
	dogName: '',
	grid: initialGrid,
  })
  **// 🐨 memoize this value with React.useMemo**
  const value = React.useMemo(() => [state, dispatch],[state]);
  return (
	<AppStateContext.Provider value={value}>
	  {children}
	</AppStateContext.Provider>
  )
}
