====== State ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

In any reasonably sized web app, the User Interface has to be stateful.

**Examples:**
	- logged in users see something different than logged out users
	- clicking "edit profile' opens up a modal (pop-up) window
	- sections of a website can expand or collapse, i.e. a side bar or clicking "read more"
	


The state of the client interface (frontend) is not always directly related to the state of the server.
