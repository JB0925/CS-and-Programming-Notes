====== componentDidUpdate ======
Created Monday 02 August 2021

Components often update during their life cycle.

Here are some situations that occur that often cause components to update:
	- your props change, **i.e. the values passed down from the PARENT components change**
	
	- **state** changes; we call **this.setState** often to update components
	
	- **forceUpdate **is called. This is called when you get data that isn't in props or state, but you want to manually force a re-render.


**If used, `componentDidUpdate will be called every time a component updates.**

This is a great function to call to implement any side effect operations, such as snycing up with `localStorage, making changes to a database, updating the DOM with non-React controlled components.


**Example:**
	class Timer extends Component {
		constructor(props) {
			super(props)
			this.state = {quote: ""}
		}
		
		`**componentDidMount() {**
			axios.get(url).then(res => {
				setTimeout(() => {
					this.setState({quote: res.data});
				}.bind(this), 3000);
			});
		**}**
		
		`**componentDidUpdate() {**
			// write code here
		}
	}
