====== componentDidMount ======
Created Monday 02 August 2021

`**componentDidMount()** runs immediately **after the FIRST render** of a component. It will NOT run again on subsequent renders.

**Why Use It?**
	- use it when you are fetching data from an API
	- use it when you need something to happen as soon as the page is loaded


**Example:**
	class Timer extends Component {
		constructor(props) {
			super(props)
			this.state = {quote: ""}
		}
		
		`**componentDidMount() {**
			axios.get(url).then(res => {
				setTimeout(() => {
					this.setState({quote: res.data});
				}.bind(this), 3000);
			});
		**}**
	}
	

**Explanation:**
	- we create the class and the constructor, and initialize state.
	- then we create `**componentDidMount** and, inside of it, we make a GET request and chain the Promise to create a setTimeout that basically says "hey, after **three** seconds, change the **state** to the result of this GET request.
