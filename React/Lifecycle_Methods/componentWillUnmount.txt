====== componentWillUnmount ======
Created Monday 02 August 2021

This method is more of a cleanup method, and is called right as a component is being torn down.

In this method, you might:
	- clear timers
	- clear intervals
	- tie up loose ends in a database
	- etc.,

There is no point in setting state in this method, as the component will not be rendered again anyway.
