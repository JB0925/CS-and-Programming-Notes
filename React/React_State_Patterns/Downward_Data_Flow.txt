====== Downward Data Flow ======
Created Friday 09 July 2021

State should live on the parent.

We want parent components to pass down data from state to child components.
	**This can be seen in the dice project where "Die" is stateless and gets its data from its parent, RollDice, which does have state.**
	
	If State is more centralized to one component, it makes it easier to debug, because where know where state is / is coming from.

	Above is the parent component, and it is stateful.

	Above is what the `**RollDie **component renders, which is a stateless, or **dumb**, Die component.

	Above is the Die component that is being rendered. Very simple, and has no state. The die component is utilizing **props**, NOT **state.**
