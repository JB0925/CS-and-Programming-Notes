====== Designing State ======
Created Friday 09 July 2021

How to design state:

1). Minimize state:
	- you want to put as little in state as possible.
	- Your Litmus test:
		- does **myProperty** change? If not, it should be a prop, not in state
		- is **myProperty** already captured by some other property in state or props? 
		  Derive it from there instead.
	
	**Example of Bad State Design:**
		this.state = {
			firstName: 'Matt',
			lastName: 'Jones',
			age: 64,
			birthday: '1955-01-08T07:56:04.711Z'
			mood: 'happy'
		}
		
		**In this example, the firstName and lastName probably never change, so they don't need to be a part of state; they can be a part of props instead.**
		
		**Also, the age will eventually change, but we have the birthday, (which doesn't change), and we can derive the age from the birthday. **
		
		**Neither age nor birthday need to be in state.**
		
		
		**Updated:**
			this.props = {
				firstName: 'Matt',
				lastName: 'Jones',
				age: 64,
				birthday: '1955-01-08T07:53:59.711Z'
			}
			
			this.state {
				mood: 'happy'
			}
