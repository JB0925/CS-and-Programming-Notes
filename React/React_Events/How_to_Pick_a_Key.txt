====== How to Pick a Key ======
Created Wednesday 14 July 2021

- The best way is to pick a string that uniquely identifies the item amongst its siblings
- Most often, you would use IDs from your data as keys (**think unique database IDs, etc.**)

When you don't have a stable ID (**again, think database IDs**), you can use the iteration ID (**the "i" in (for let i = 0;...)**)
	**Example:**
		let nums = this.state.nums.map((num, index) => {
			<NumberItem key={index} value={num} onClick={this.remove}/>
		});
	
	**NOTE:** This will only work if your data does not need to change. If your data needs to change (something gets added or removed, etc.), then don't use it.
	
	Another good way to get these ids to be unique is to use libraries such as **shortId **and **uuid**
