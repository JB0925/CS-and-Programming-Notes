====== Where to Bind ======
Created Wednesday 14 July 2021

- It's always better to bind higher up, preferably in the constructor
- **if you need a parameter, pass it to the CHILD as a prop, then BIND in the PARENT and the CHILD**
- avoid inline arrow functions and binding if possible

- **ONLY** need to bind in the **constructor**
