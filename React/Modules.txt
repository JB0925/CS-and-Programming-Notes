====== Modules ======
Created Sunday 20 June 2021

1). Any time you want to use a component, function, etc., that is in another file, you need to add:
	**export default functionNameHere**


2). Then, **in the file you want to import it into**, you need to add:
	**import functionName from "./filename"**

3). Any time you want to import a **module**, you write:
	**import functionName from "module"**
	
	**NOTE:** You can give your function name an alias, so instead of:
		**import help from "./helpers"**
	
	You can write:
		**import h from "./helpers"**
	
	If you do this, whenever you call the function, you need to refer to it with whatever alias you gave it.


**Exporting a function:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/React - export a function.png}}

**Importing the same function:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/React - Import a Function.png}}

See the bottom of the imports, then see where we **console.log()** our function.
