====== Standard React File Setup ======
Created Thursday 10 June 2021

Instead of having your component in your **index.js** or **app.js** file, instead you will make a **hello.js** file, that is only for that component.

From there, you will link it above the **index / app.js **file.


Inside of the **index/app.js** file, you will create a **top-level component**, typically called **App**.

Inside of this component, you will render the other components into the DOM.

Example on next page.
