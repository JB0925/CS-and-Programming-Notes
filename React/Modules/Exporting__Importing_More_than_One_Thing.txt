====== Exporting  Importing More than One Thing ======
Created Sunday 20 June 2021

If I want to export more than one thing from a file, remove **default**, and wrap those items in curly braces:

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/React - Export More than one thing.png}}


**To import them into another file, use the same curly braces:**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/React - Importin Multiple Things.png}}

Last line, you can see how we wrapped **help, dumb, stupid** in curly braces to import them.
