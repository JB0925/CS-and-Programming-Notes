====== How to Embed an Image as a Prop ======
Created Friday 18 June 2021

To embed an image, the process is almost the same:

**Passing the Prop Into the App Component:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Props-Passing in an Image.png}}

Here we can see how the **img** prop is passed into the call to the **Hello **component.

**Using the Image in the Hello Component:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Using Image Prop in Hello Component.png}}

Here, we embed the image in a div, and **set the image src to "this.props.img".** 

Again, notice how it is surrounded in curly braces.
