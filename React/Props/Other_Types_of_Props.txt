====== Other Types of Props ======
Created Friday 18 June 2021

We've seen how we can embed **props** that are string:
	**<User name="Jane" title="CEO"/>**
	
	To do that, we just enclose the string in quotes like normal.
	

For other types, such as Numbers, arrays, etc., we **surround them with curly braces { }.**

	**<User name="Jane" salary={ 100000 }**
		**hobbies={ ['bridge', 'reading', 'tea'] }/>**
		
	Note how the Number type and the array type are surrounded with the curly braces.


**Booleans:**
	To add a boolean, you can do the same thing:
		**isFunny={true}**
			
			OR
		**isFunny**
		
	If you just pass it in by itself, it will evaluate to **true**. If you want it to be **false**, then you will have to manually pass that in.
	

**Example of Non-String Props:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Props that aren't strings.png}}

Here we can see that we passed in the **num** prop in curly braces, so we could pass it the number 5.

**How We Use It:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Using Non-String Props.png}}

Here we set the variable **bangs** to an exclamation point that repeats **this.props.num** times.

We then pass it into the **h1** that we are returning.

Since, in **index.js (our App component)**, we made bangs = 5, it will put 5 exclamation points after **this.props.from**.
