====== Creating Props in Hello Component ======
Created Sunday 13 June 2021

**Example "Hello" Component:**
	class Hello extends React.Component {
		render() {
			console.log(this.props);
			return <h1>Hello There!</h1>
		};
	};
	
	

**So how do we pass the "to" and "from" props in?**
	- on the **index.js** file, when rendering the app and calling the component, you will pass in the **props** as if they were HTML attributes:
	
	**Example:**
		class App extends React.Component {
			render() {
				return (
					<div>
						<Hello to="**ringo**" from="**paul**"/>
						<NumPicker/>
					</div>
				)
			}
		}	
		
		**The "to" and "from" are the props.**
		

	Thinking back to our **console.log(this.props)** statement in the **Hello** component, it will now have an **Object** with {from: "ringo", to: "paul"} in it.
	
	Because it is an **Object**, you could console.log(**this.props.to**) or console.log(**this.props.from**) like you could with any other object.
	

**Let's Rewrite Our Hello Component to Include the Usage of the "to" and "from" Props:**

	class Hello extends React.Component {
		render() {
			return <h1>Hi {this.props.to} from {this.props.from}.</h1>
		};
	};
	
	
	**Now, if we run our app, we see:**
		**Hi Ringo from Paul.**
