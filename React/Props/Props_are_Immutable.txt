====== Props are Immutable ======
Created Friday 18 June 2021

In React, props are immutable, which means they can't be changed.

Your data can definitely change, but you don't manually change it.

In other words, **props are "read-only"**.

**Example:**

class Hello extends React.Component {
	render() {
		**this.props.from = "Bob";**
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>Hello {this.props.to} from {this.props.from}
			</div>
		)
	}
}

**The above will NOT work**, because you are trying to write a prop, and props are read-only.
