====== Inline Styles ======
Created Saturday 19 June 2021

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Add Style Tag to React Component.png}}

Here, you can see that we took away the **className** attribute, and we added an inline style.

To do that, we set **style={colors}**

Above, we created the **colors** object, that we passed into our div.
