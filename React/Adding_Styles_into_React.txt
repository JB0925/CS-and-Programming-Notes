====== Adding Styles into React ======
Created Saturday 19 June 2021

1). Create your CSS file, add it in a link tag to the HTML.

2). **It is standard** to add a class that has the same name as your component.
	So, if your component is called "Machine", in your CSS file, you'd have a class called "**.Machine"**.

3). In your component, where you'd normally have:
	**<div class="Machine"></div>**
	
	In React, it is actually:
		**<div className="Machine"></div>**

Here, you can see where we added **className="Machine"** to the div in the Machine component.
