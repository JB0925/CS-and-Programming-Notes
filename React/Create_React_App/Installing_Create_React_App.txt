====== Installing Create React App ======
Created Saturday 19 June 2021

**First Way:**
	In the terminal, run:
		**npx create-react-app myApp**


**Second Way:**
	Since node is installed globally, we can just run:
		**create-react-app myApp**


**Third Way:**
	Install CRA globally with:
		**npm install -g create-react-app**
		
	After this, we can just run **create-react-app myApp **on its own
