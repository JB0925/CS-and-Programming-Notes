====== CSS and Assets in CRA ======
Created Thursday 24 June 2021

You can import CSS and images, etc., directly into JS files with Create React App.

**Example:**
	(top of file)
	
	import React, { Component } from "react";
	**import myImage from "./myImage.jpg";**
	**import "./App.css";**


**Standard Way to Handle CSS in Create React App:**
	- make a CSS file for each component
		- **House.css** for the **House** component, etc.
		
	- **import **the CSS file at the top of the **component** file
		- Create React App with automatically load that CSS
		
		
	- It is **convention** to give the **top level element** in your component **"className="Filename"**, where **Filename** is the CSS file name.
	
	- **ALL** lower elements in the component get prefixed with **Filename-title, Filename-address, etc.**
	
	
	**Example:**
		<div **className="House">**
			<p **className="House-title"**>{ this.props.title }</p>
			<p **className="House-address"**>{ this.props.address }</p>
		</div>
		
	
	**NOTE: **Any styles defined in the CSS file **DO NOT** apply **ONLY** to the component. They will apply to anything that matches the selectors in the CSS file, so be careful.
	
	**NOTE2: **If you want to, you can create a **src/css** and/or a **src/img** directory if you have a lot of these files. It's up to you! Just make sure to reference the path correctly.
