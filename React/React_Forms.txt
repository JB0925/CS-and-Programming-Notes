====== React Forms ======
Created Wednesday 21 July 2021

HTML form elements work a little differently than other DOM elements in React

**Form elements naturally keep internal state**

**It's a good idea to:**
	- have a JS function that **handles form submission**
	- has access to the data the user entered

The technique to make the above work is called **controlled components**
