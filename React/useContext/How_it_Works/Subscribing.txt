====== Subscribing ======
Created Saturday 23 October 2021

Any component inside of a Provider has access to the **value** prop...as long as they are subscribed to the Provider.

**How to Subscribe:**

In all child / grandchild, etc., components that you want to have access to the **value** prop:

import React, { **useContext** } from "react";
import CountContext from "./Context";

const GreatGrandChildComponent = () => {
	**const value = useContext(CountContext);**
}


Now you can use whatever was passed in to **Context.Provider, **state will update, and components will re-render.
