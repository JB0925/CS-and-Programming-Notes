====== How it Works ======
Created Saturday 23 October 2021

1). Create a file called Context.js or something similar.

2). This is what goes in it:
	import React from "react";
	
	const CountContext = React.createContext();
	
	export default CountContext;

3). In your component file:
	**import CountContext from "./Context";**
	

4). Use **Context.provider** by wrapping it around whatever you are returning in your component:
	return (
		<CountContext.Provider>
			<div className="myComponent">
				<h1>Hello<h1>
			</div>
		</CountContext.Provider>
	)
	
5). Context.Provider has a **value** prop that allows us to pass around data between multiple components. **You can only pass in ONE thing **to the **value** prop, BUT that one thing can be an object, array, etc., i.e. something to hold more than one data point.

6). Now, **everything **inside of the **Context.Provider** wrapper, including any and all child components, has access to the **value** prop....with a catch....see **Subscribing** for more.
