====== Example of Setting and Changing State in React ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

Here is a small example of how to change state in React using **this.setState()**.

**Here is the App Component:**
	- notice how is is passed the **prop** called **maxNum**. This is used in **Rando.js**

**Rando Component:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Changing State in React - pt2.png}}

**NOTES: **
	- remember, to use state, we have to set it up with the addition of the constructor
	
	- then, we create another method **makeTimer()** and call **this.setState({num: rand});**
