====== State Changes ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

State is designed to constantly change in response to events (**clicks, etc.**)

Think of a chess board. Every move by each player, represents a state change.


**What Does State Track?**
	- Frontend / client state tracks:
		- **UI logic: The modal pops up when the button is clicked**
		
		- **Business Logic: The changing state of data, i.e. in an email inbox, messages are displayed differently based on whether they are read or unread**
