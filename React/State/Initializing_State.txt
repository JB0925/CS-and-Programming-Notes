====== Initializing State ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

**React Concepts:**
	- **Components:**
		- building block of React
		- combines logic (**JS**) and presentation (**JSX**)
	
	**- Props:**
		- data passed to components (or found via defaults)
		- immutable; component cannot change / write its own props
		
	**- State:**
		- internal data specific to a component
		- data that changes over time
		
	
	**NOTE:** If something doesn't change, you'll most likely make it a **prop** instead of **state.**
	


In **React**, **state** is an **instance attribute on a component.**

It is **ALWAYS** called **state.**

It is a simple JS object.

If you want your component to have state, it cannot be a function (must be a class).

**State** should be **initialized **as soon as the component is created.
