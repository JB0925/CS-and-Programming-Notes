====== How to Build a Component With State ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props)
		this.state = {
			**// our values go here**
		};
	};
};

You **must** call **super(props)** at the start of the constructor; this **registers** your class as a **React Component (inherits from Component).**

Inside the **instance methods, **you can refer to **this.state** just like we did with **this.props**


**Another Example:**
	import React, { Component } from "react";
	
	class Battleship extends Component {
		constructor(props) {
			super(props)
			this.state = {
				player: 'Whiskey',
				score: 0
			};
		};

		render() {
			return (
				<div>
					<h1>Battleship Game</h1>
					<img src={myImg} alt="image"/>
				</div>
			);
		}
	}
