====== Write an EventListener Method ======
Created Wednesday 30 June 2021

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/React - Binding a Method to an Event.png}}

Here, we wrote our normal React component with a constructor to set up **state.**

We create the **handleClick** function, and pass it in to the **button** in our **return **statement.

**In the constructor**, we **bind** the **handleClick** to **this** to set the context for the **handleClick** method. 

We will need to do this going forward.


**An Alternative to Bind:**
	- you can forego the **bind** call; just do two things:
	
	1). Drop the constructor:
			**state = {**
				// stuff here
			**}**
	
	2). Define the callback as an **arrow function**:
			**handleClick = e => {**
				**this.setState({clicked: true});**
			**}**
	
	
	Doing these two things automatically sets the context of the method, so that a bind call is not necessary.
