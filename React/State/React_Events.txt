====== React Events ======
Created Wednesday 30 June 2021

**State** most commonly changes in response to some event, typically caused by the user.

In **React**, every JSX element has built in attributes representing every kind of browser event.

They are all camel-cased (**onClick**), and take callbacks as event listeners.

**Example:**
	<button **onClick**=(function(e) { alert('Hello World!'); })>
		Click Me!
	</button>

	**NOTE:** Functions are not typically written inline, but they can be, as shown above.
