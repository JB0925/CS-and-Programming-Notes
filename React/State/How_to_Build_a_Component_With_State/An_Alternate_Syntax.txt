====== An Alternate Syntax ======
Created Friday 25 June 2021

import React, { Component } from "react";

class Game extends Component {
	state = {
		score: 0,
		gameOver: false
	};
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<h1>Score: {this.state.score}</h1>
			</div>
		)
	}
}

You can use the above **alternate syntax** to create **state**.

This is technically not valid JS, but Babel is translating it into valid JS.

This is only enabled via a plugin from Babel, and Create-react-app has this plugin built into it.
