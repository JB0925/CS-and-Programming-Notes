====== Action Types ======
Created Monday 01 November 2021

For the **type** key in the **action** that gets passed into the reducer, it is common to separate them out into their own file as constant, and then import them. This gives us:

1). Better autocomplete
2). If something gets typed incorrectly, you will recieve a "not defined" error, rather than failing silently.

**Example:**

reduxActionTypes.js

**export const ADD = "ADD";**
**export const REMOVE = "REMOVE";**
**export const UPDATE = "UPDATE";**
