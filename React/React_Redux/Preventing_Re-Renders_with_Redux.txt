====== Preventing Re-Renders with Redux ======
Created Monday 01 November 2021

The easiest way to prevent re-renders with Redux is to import **shallowEqual** from "react-redux", and then use it as the second argument in the useSelector hook. This is helpful when dealing with objects or arrays.

**Example:**

import { useSelector, shallowEqual } from "react-redux";

const { num1, num2 } = useSelector(state => ({
	num1: state.num1,
	num2: state.num2
}), **shallowEqual**);
