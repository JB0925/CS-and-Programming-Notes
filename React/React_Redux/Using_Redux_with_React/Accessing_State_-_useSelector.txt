====== Accessing State - useSelector ======
Created Sunday 31 October 2021

To access state with Redux, use useSelector

**import { useSelector } from "react-redux";**

const Counter = () => {
	**const count = useSelector(store => store.count);**
	// doing this allows us to access the "count" key from the Redux store.
};
