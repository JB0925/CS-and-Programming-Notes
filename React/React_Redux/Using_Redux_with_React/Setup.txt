====== Setup ======
Created Sunday 31 October 2021

To install React Redux:
	**npm install react-redux    AND      npm install redux**


**Steps:**
	1). You need to wrap your App component in a top-level component called **<Provider /> **
	
	2). You need a **reducer** function


**The Provider:**
	- the Provider accepts a prop of a Redux store
	- usually we wrap the Provider around the app component in index.js, similarly to how we do it with BrowserRouter. 
	

**Example:**
	**index.js**
	import { Provider } from "react-redux";
	import myReducer from "./myReducerFile"
	import { createStore } from "redux";
	
	const store = createStore(myReducer);
	
	ReactDOM.render(
		<Provider store={store}>
			<App /> 
		</Provider>
	);
