====== Actions ======
Created Friday 29 October 2021

**Action **is the second parameter given in the **reducer** function.

Reducer functions are never called directly; instead we fire off an **action**, which gets intercepted and processed by a **reducer**.

Actions are simple instructions that tell **reducer functions** how to handle and modify state.

**Actions** are objects that have a "**type**" key.

**action.type**'s value is, by convention, an upper snake case string, i.e. "HELLO_THERE"

The action is passed into the **dispatch** function, i.e. **store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });**


**Other action keys:**
	- actions can have other keys. A common one to have is the **payload** key, which can be anything you want, and can be used when the action is dispatched.
