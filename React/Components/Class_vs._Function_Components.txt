====== Class vs. Function Components ======
Created Wednesday 02 June 2021

**Class Components:**
	- This is the traditional React component
	- Here, you write logic in a JS class to make a component
	- **a Class component** must include a **render()** method


**Function Components:**
	- they are a standard JS function
	- not as powerful as a Class component, but are now more powerful due to **React hooks.**



**Similarities and Differences:**
	- Both can accept **props** and render content
	- Function components did not used to be able to use important features like:
		- state
		- lifecycle methods
	
	- since the introduction of **hooks**, we can now write full-featured function components
