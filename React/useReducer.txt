====== useReducer ======
Created Tuesday 07 December 2021

Typically, useReducer is used with an object of state. Here is a simpler example, with just a name:

**NOTES:**
  1). useReducer always takes two arguments
	  - a **reducer function** as the first argument. This fn tells how to update the reducer.
	  - the initial value to start with.

const nameReducer = (previousName, newName) => {
  return newName;
};

const initialName = "Joe";

**Here, "nameReducer" is the action or reducer function, and "initialName" is the initial value for the reducer.**

const NameInput = () => {
  **const [name, setName] = useReducer(nameReducer, initialName);**
  const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value);

  return (
	..;.
  );
};
