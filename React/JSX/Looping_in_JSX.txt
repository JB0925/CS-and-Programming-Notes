====== Looping in JSX ======
Created Saturday 19 June 2021

The **most common** way to loop in JSX is to use **map**.

**Example:**
	class Messages extends React.Component {
		render() {
			const messages = [
				{id: 1, msg: 'Greetings'},
				{id: 2, msg: 'Goodbye!'}
			]
			return (
				<ul>
					**{ messages.map(m => <li>{m.msg}</li>) } **
				</ul>
			)
		}
	}
	
	**NOTES: **Notice how the **enitre** map statement is enclosed in curly braces, and then, inside the arrow function, we create the **li**. Finally, we close the curly brace.


**Another Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Looping in JSX.png}}

Here we created the **myMessages** array, then passed it in as props to the call to **Loops**.

**How we use it:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Looping in JSX Part 2.png}}

Here, we **destructure** props, and use **map** to loop through the array.


**Another Way to Do What's Directly Above:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Another Way to Handle Looping in JSX.png}}

Here, we destructed again, but we did the **map** function right after we destructured.

Then, we pass the **array of <li>'s** in curly braces between the **<ul>**.
