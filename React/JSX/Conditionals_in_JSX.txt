====== Conditionals in JSX ======
Created Sunday 06 June 2021

How can we render conditional code in JSX?

**Example 1 - Ternary Operators:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/JSX Conditional 1.png}}

Here, we have created a Component called "NumPicker".

Inside of the **<p>** tag, we are rendering conditional code. If **num === 7**, we render "Congrats!" inside the **p** tag. Else, we render **try again later...**

**NOTE: **Notice the placement of the call to **randomNum(). **It is placed outside of the **return** but inside of **render. This is done so that it won't be called twice. **


**Want to Add an Image?**

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/JSX Conditional Image.png}}

This code is the same as above, except this time we used a ternary operator to conditionally display an image.



**Another Way to Display the Image:**
	Since we only want to display the image if the number is 7, and we don't want to display anything in that space otherwise, we can use a boolean statement:
	
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/React Conditional Boolean Operator.png}}
	

**A Third Way to Display Conditional Code:**
	We can simply use if / else statements, we just have to put them **inside** the "**render**" statement, but **outside** the "**return**" statement.
	
	{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/If : Else React Component.png}}
	
	Above the the refactored **render()** statement, now using if / else conditional code rather than **ternary** or **boolean** operators.
