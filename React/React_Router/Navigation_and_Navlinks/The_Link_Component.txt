====== The Link Component ======
Created Sunday 08 August 2021

In a Navbar, if you have anchor tags with an href, any time that they are clicked it will refresh the entire page. In Client Side routing, that is not what we want.

To get around this, we can use the **Link** Component:

1). Instead of an href, it takes a prop called **to**

2). Clicking a Link Component does not refresh the page; it gets intercepted by JS, and Client Side Routing is done.

**NOTE: **These are great for anchor tags on any part of the page, but anchor tags in the Navbar actually have a special component called **`NavLink**. Learn more on next page.

**Example:**
	import { Route, Switch, Link } from "react-router-dom"
	
	class App extends Component {
		render() {
			return (
				<div className="App">
					<nav>
						<ul>
							**<Link to="/route1">Route 1</Link>**
							**<Link to="/route2">Route 2</Link>**
						</ul>
					</nav>
				</div>
			)
		}
	}
