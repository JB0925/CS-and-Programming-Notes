====== The NavLink Component ======
Created Sunday 08 August 2021

The `**NavLink** component has the same syntax as the **Link** component, except that there is a special prop called **activeClassName** that allows you to give a nav link a special style to show that the page is active.

**Example:**
	**<NavLink exact activeClassName="class-name-here" to="/route1">About</NavLink>**
