====== Testing a Component that uses useParams ======
Created Thursday 21 October 2021

In order to test a component that uses **useParams**, where part of the component relies on the route parameters being given by the user, you need to wrap your component (for the test) in a **MemoryRouter AND a Route with a path.**

**Example:**
{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Testing With useParams.png}}


Another option is to put the example from above in its own function and then call that function with the component you want to test:

**import {Route, MemoryRouter} from 'react-router-dom';**

...

const renderWithRouter = (component) => (
  render(
	<MemoryRouter initialEntries={['blogs/1']}>
	  <Route path='blogs/:blogId'>
		{component}
	  </Route>
	</MemoryRouter>
  )
)
