====== Client Side Routing ======
Created Saturday 07 August 2021

**Client Side Routing** handles the mapping between the **address bar** and the content a user sees **via browser** instead of via server.

Sites that only use client side routing are single page applications

We use **JS** to manipulate the URL / address bar with a Web API called **History**
