====== useHistory ======
Created Tuesday 19 October 2021

The **history** object is a wrapper for the **window.history** object that we can access in the browser console.

We have access to the history object using the **useHistory** hook.

The **history object** has a "**.push(url)**" method that adds the URL to the session history.

Unlike **<Redirect />**, hitting the back button will return to the page that we got redirected **from**.

**Example:**
	import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
	
	const Contact = () => {
		**const history = useHistory();**
		
		const handleSubmit = evt => {
			evt.preventDefault();
			**history.push("/");**
		};
	};
	

The example above would redirect us to the home page / base route whenever a form is submitted.
