====== Switch ======
Created Tuesday 19 October 2021

By default, Routes are matched **inclusively.**

This means that the Route component will possibly match multiple components, even if **exact** is used in the Route component.

**How to Use Switch:**
	import { Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
	
	const App = () => {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				**<Switch>**
					<Route exact path="/">
						<Home />
					</Route>
					<Route exact path="/food/new">
						<NewFood />
					</Route>
					<Route exact path="/food/:name">
						<Food />
					</Route>
				**</Switch>**
			</div>
		);
	};
	
**Explanation:**
	By using a **Switch** component, we are able to achieve **exclusive** routing, meaning it will only return the **first** match. 
	
	For example, the "/food/new" and "/food/:name", if we typed "**/food/new**" into the browser without using a Switch, we would render both the NewFood and the Food components, because of the route parameter in **"/food/:name**" where **name** matches anything.
	
	With a Switch, the **order of the routes matters**, so if there are any conflicts, the **most specific** routes need to come first.
