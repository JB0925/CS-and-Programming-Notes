====== React Fragment ======
Created Saturday 09 October 2021

in a typical React component, you need to return ONE element, and then that element may have children.

To get around this in Create-React-App, we can use **React Fragment. **React Fragment is like a wrapper or dummy element that wraps around what would normally be several child components.

**NOTE: **You can put in **React.Fragment** inside the opening and closing tags, but you can also leave them empty, like below.

**Example:**
	const Book = props => {
		return (
			**<>**
				<h1>Stuff</h1>
				<p>more stuff</p>
			**</>**
		)
	}
