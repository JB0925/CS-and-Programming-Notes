====== Lifecycle Methods ======
Created Monday 02 August 2021

Lifecycle Methods refer to specific points in a Component's lifecycle. 

For example, **componentDidMount()** refers to the time immediately after a component renders for the **first** time.

There are **three** phases of the Component life cycle:
	1). Mounting
	
	2). Updating
	
	3). Unmounting
