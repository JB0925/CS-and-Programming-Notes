====== Making it Work ======
Created Wednesday 21 July 2021

1). Set the **value** attribute on the input to be some part of the **state,**
		maybe **this.state.fullName**, for example.

2). Since **handleChange **runs on every keystroke to update the React state,
	 the displayed value will update as the user types.

3). Every state mutation will have an associated handler function. This makes it easy to modify or change state.
		**Example:**
			handleChange(evt) {
				this.setState({
					fullName: evt.target.value
				});
				
			}

4). An **onSubmit** event is added to the form element itself. This is used to clear the input and start **username** over as an empty string.
