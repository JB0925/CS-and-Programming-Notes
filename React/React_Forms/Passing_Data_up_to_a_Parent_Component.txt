====== Passing Data up to a Parent Component ======
Created Thursday 22 July 2021

Typically in React, we have downward data flow, where "smart", stateful parent components pass down data to the simpler child components.

Let's pretend that we have a shopping list that is our parent component.

Then, we have a `ShoppingListForm child component.
	- We want to pass data to the actual shopping list, so that the shopping list's **state** is updated by the form inputs ech time they change
