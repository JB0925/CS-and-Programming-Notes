====== Hook to Only Make AJAX calls if the Component is Mounted ======
Created Thursday 09 December 2021

**Both of these would go inside of the Component to be created itself, though they could of course be abstracted into a different file, etc.**

const useMountedState = () => {
	const isMounted = React.useRef(false);
	
	React.useEffect(() => {
	  isMounted.current = true;      **// setting the ref.current to true on mount**
	  return () => {
		isMounted.current = false;   **// cleanup function, sets ref.current to false**
	  };
	},[]);

	return React.useCallback(isMounted.current, []) **return a memoized version of isMounted.current**
  }

  const currentlyMounted = useMountedState();     **// calling useMountedState();**
  
  React.useEffect(() => {
	  **// if it's not BOTH mounted AND we have a pokemonName. just return early.**
	  **// otherwise, return async function call**
	if (!pokemonName && !currentlyMounted) return;
	return run(fetchPokemon(pokemonName));
  }, [pokemonName, run]);

	 **// remember, "run" is just the async function that we turned into a "useCallback" function. It simply sets the state via "dispatch" if the call was successful, and sets the state's error info if unsuccessful.**
