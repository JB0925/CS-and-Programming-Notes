====== useCallback ======
Created Tuesday 07 December 2021

**useCallback** works in a similar way, but uses a callback function.

const launch = React.useCallback(() => launchCandy({type, distance}), [
  type,
  distance,
]);

The **previous result** is the function, and the **previous input** is the dependency array.


**How It Works:**

// initial render with type = 'twix' and distance = '15m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback this render

// rerender with type = 'twix' and distance = '15m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback last render ðŸ¤“

// rerender with same type = 'twix' and distance '20m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback this render

// rerender with type = 'twix' and distance = '15m':
// - launch is equal to the callback passed to useCallback this render
