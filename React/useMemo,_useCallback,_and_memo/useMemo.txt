====== useMemo ======
Created Tuesday 07 December 2021

**useMemo** is a way to cache / memoize the results of specific functions.

It takes a **dependency array, **just like useEffect. The dependency array means that that the **memo** will be updated when the value in the dependency array changes.

const posts = React.useMemo(() => getPosts(searchTerm), [searchTerm])

**The above is memoizing the result of "getPosts" to save those so that the function doesn't have to be called again if the searchTerm does not change.**

**How It Works:**

// initial render with searchTerm = 'puppies':
// - getPosts is called
// - posts is a new array of posts

// rerender with searchTerm = 'puppies':
// - getPosts is ***not*** called
// - posts is the same as last time ðŸ¤“

// rerender with searchTerm = 'cats':
// - getPosts is called
// - posts is a new array of posts

// rerender render with searchTerm = 'puppies' (again):
// - getPosts is called
// - posts is a new array of posts
