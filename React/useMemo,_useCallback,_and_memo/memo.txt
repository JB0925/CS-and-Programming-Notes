====== memo ======
Created Tuesday 07 December 2021

Here is an example of how to use **memo:**

**NOTE:** Remember, React's memo size is 1, so as soon as the component is called again with new props, the previous props that were in the **memo** are now gone.

import { **memo** } from "react";

const MemoizedComponent = memo(MyComponent);

// then, when you render it:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="b" /> // renders **MyComponent** with **new** elements

// rerender it with the same props:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="b" /> // renders it with previous elements 
ðŸ¤“
// rerender it again but with different props:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="c" /> // renders new elements

// rerender it again with the same props as at first:
<MemoComp prop1="a" prop2="b" /> // renders new elements
