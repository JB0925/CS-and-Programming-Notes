====== Trees-Into to Hierarchical Data ======
Created Thursday 24 September 2020

All the data structures so far have been **linear** (**arrays, arrayLists, stacks, queues, Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Dictionaries)**

**Trees store data hierarchically instead of linearly.**

A real world example is a **Family Tree**, where the people in the tree aren't stored linearly; they are stored hierarchically

Another example is the file structure on your computer (**folders inside of folders inside of folders, then find your document)**
