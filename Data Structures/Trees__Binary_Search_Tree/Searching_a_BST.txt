====== Searching a BST ======
Created Wednesday 21 July 2021

**Pseudocode:**
	1). Designate a node to be the "current node". This is always the root node at the beginning of the algorithm.
	
	2). If **current node** == value we are searching for, return it.
	
	3). If the value we are looking for is **less than** the current node's value, we search **current node's LEFT **subtree.
	
	4). If **cur.val < search.val**, we search **cur's RIGHT subtree.**
