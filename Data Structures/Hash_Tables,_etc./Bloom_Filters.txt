====== Bloom Filters ======
Created Friday 06 May 2022

**Bloom Filters** are a special kind of **set** data structure that is based on hashing.

There are two main operations in a Bloom Filter:
	1). Insertion
	2). Lookup
	
**How it works:**
	- Choose a number of bits
	- Make a **bit-list **(the Bloom Filter table) that has the size of the above number of bits, set each place in the list to **False or 0**
	
	- Choose a number of random hash functions to use
	- Create a list of the above number of random hash functions
	
	**To Insert:    (pretend it's a word we are inserting)**
		- for hash_function in hash_function_family:
			index = hash_function(word)
			**bit-list[index] = 1**
	
	**To Look up the Word:**
		- for hash_function in hash_function_family:
			index = hash_function(word)
			if bit-list[index] ! = 1:
				return False
		
		return True
