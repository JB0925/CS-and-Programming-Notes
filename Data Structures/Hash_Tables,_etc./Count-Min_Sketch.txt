====== Count-Min Sketch ======
Created Saturday 07 May 2022

A **Count-Min Sketch** is essentially using a hash table to approximate a count of some type of object or multiple objects.

Think of this as what you do when you want to get the count of each word in a text document; you place all of their keys and values into a dictionary or object, and keep a running total.

It is also pretty much the same as using **collections.Counter** in Python.


**The Difference:**
	- Because of the fact that there may be collisions, and **count-min sketches** do NOT try to handle collisions, the **counts are only approximate.**
	
	- You would not use a **count-min sketch** if you needed to know the EXACT count of something.
