====== Properties of a Red-Black Tree ======
Created Sunday 08 May 2022

A **red-black tree** is a BST with some extra "stuff".

Every node has a color; either **red** or **black**.
	- it is a single bit of info.
	

**Rules of a RB Tree:**
	- the Root and the NIL nodes (if applicable) are **black**
	- Every **red** node **must have BOTH** of its children be **black** child nodes
	- Number of **black nodes** on any path from any node to a leaf must be the same
	
	**Example of Rule Three:**
		- **Path #1: **
			- Start at 10, visit 8, 6, N
				- there are **four black nodes**
		
		**- Path #2:**
			- Start at 10, visit 12, 11, 11.5, 11.2, N
			- there are six nodes overall, but **still four black nodes** along the path
		
		
		No matter which path is taken from the starting node (10, in this case) to a leaf, it will always have four **black** nodes on any path from the starting node to a leaf.
