====== DFS and BFS - Discovery and Finish Times ======
Created Sunday 15 May 2022

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/DFS Start and Finish Times.png}}

**For this analysis of the Discovery and Finish times for each node, we will start at node 1.**
**NOTE: **Scroll to bottom to see these nodes topologically sorted.

Discovery = when you visit the node the first time
Finish = when the node has no other edges to visit that have not already been included in the DFS tree.

Node		Discovery		Finish
   1			      1			   8
   2			      9			  20
   3			      2			   7
   4			     10			  19
   5			      3	   		   6
   6			     11			  18
   7			     12			  17
   8			      4			   5
   9			     13			  16
   10			     14			  15


**Explanation:**
	- Node 1 is our starting node
	- on to Node 3 (discover time of 2 because it is the next stop in the chain)
	- on to Node 5 (discover time of 3)
	- on to Node 8 (discover time of 4)
		- wait....Node 8 has no other edges to visit. It is finished. Mark as Finished with time of 5.
	- go back to Node 5
		- Node 5 is finished (no other edges to pursue). Mark as Finished with time of 6.
	- go back to 3
		- Finished with time of 7
	- go back to 1
		- Finished with time of 8
	- Next up since we have traveled back to the start is 2. Visited time of 9.
	- on to 4 (discover time of 10)
	- on to 6 (discover time of 11)
	- on to 7 (discover time of 12)
	- on to 9 (discover time of 13)
	- on to 10 (discover time of 14)
		- Node 10 has no other edges to pursue. It is Finished with time of 15.
	- back to 9...also Finished. Time of 16.
	- back to 7...also Finished. Time of 17.
	- back to 6...also Finished. Time of 18.
	- back to 4...also Finished. Time of 19.
	- back to 2...also Finished. Time of 20.
	
**Topologically Sorted Nodes:**
	- Remember, topologically sorting the nodes means sorting them in **descending order** by their finish times.
	
	- 2 will be first since it has the highest finish time, and 8 will be last (lowest finish time).
	- [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 1, 3, 5, 8]
