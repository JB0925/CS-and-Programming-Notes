**Cross Edges:**
	- In the graph above, 2 → 3 is a cross edge. This is because they do not have any common ancestor and there is a descendant relationship between them ( 3 descends from 2).
	
**Forward Edges:**
	- In the graph above, 2 → 4 is a **Forward edge** in a DFS tree. This is because 4 descends from 2, but **2 → 4** is NOT a part of the DFS tree ( because it goes from 2 → 3 and 3 → 4 ).

**Back Edges:**
	- There is no Back Edge in the Graph above. However, consider this:
		1 → 2, 2 → 4, 4 → 6, 6 → 2
		
	- The DFS tree goes from 1 → 2 → 4 → 6, but then 6 also shares an edge with 2 (2 ascends from 6)
	
	**NOTE: ** Back Edges are indicative of a cycle in a directed graph.
