====== Arrays (Lists) ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

- list of similar values
- can be used to store anything
- store values of the same type

- items in an array are called **elements**
- the collection of elements is called an **array**

An array usually has 3 attributes:
	- **A name**
	- **A type**
	- **A size**
	

**Name: **name for the array, used to reference it and interact with it

**Parallel Arrays:**
	- two or more arrays that:
		- Contain the same number of elements
		- Have corresponding values in the same position (array1[0] is related to array2[0])
	
	- Parallel Arrays are great for storing different types of data about the same entity
	
	
**Type:**
	- what type of information is stored or will be stored
	- an array has to hold all the same type of information
	
	
**Size:**
	- a set integer that is fixed upon creation of the array
		- represents the **total amount of elements** that are able to be stored in the array
		- cannot be changed

**Indexes:**
	- start at 0
	- use arrayname[5] to get the 5th element of the array
	- access the last element of an array of size 10 = arrayname[9] or arrayname[-1]
	
**Replacing Elements:**
	- arrayname[9] = 11 .....take the 9th element of the array, and replace it with the number 11
	

**Two Dimensional Arrays:**
	- an array with an array **at each index** is known as a 2-dimensional array
	
**Referencing an Element in a 2-D Array:**
	- array = [[1,3,5], [5,7,9 ]]   
	- array[1][2] = 9     (2nd element of index 1)
