====== Actual Time Complexity Equations ======
Created Wednesday 23 September 2020

With a dictionary, the worst-case scenario (a Linked List where every key is stored at the same index in the dictionary) is not likely to ever happen, given a bare minimum functioning Hash Function.

**IF** it did:
	1). Accessing O(n)
	2). Searching O(n)
	3). Inserting O(n)
	4). Deleting O(n)
	
**OR....** the exact same thing as a Linked List.


Here are the **average** case scenarios for Time Complexity Equations for Dictionaries:
	1). Accessing = O(1)
	2). Searching = O(1)
	3). Inserting = O(1)
	4). Deleting = O(1)			**To do any of the four operations to the left with a dictionary, all that needs to happen is to run the key**
									**through a Hash Function and it will tell us what index in the Hash Table to go to in order to perform that **
									**operation**
