====== The Doubly Linked List ======
Created Sunday 20 September 2020

**Doubly Linked List:**
	- sequential access data structure which stores data in the form of Nodes
		- **important: **with a Doubly Linked List, you can traverse both **FORWARDS** and **BACKWARDS**, which is unlike a Linked List
	
	- a Doubly Linked List has Nodes:
		- each Node has 1). data, 2). a forward pointer, 3). a backwards pointer
		- this differs from a Linked List, where it only has a forward pointer
