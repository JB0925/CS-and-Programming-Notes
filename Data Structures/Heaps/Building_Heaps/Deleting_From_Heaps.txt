====== Deleting From Heaps ======
Created Monday 28 September 2020

**Deleting From the Root Node:**
	- **3 step process:**
		1). Delete the Root Node
		2). Replace it with the Node furthest to the RIGHT
		3). "Heapify"....compare the parent Nodes with their child Nodes and, if swaps are necessary, make those swaps.

**Example: In the picture below, steps 1 and two have been completed (100 is gone, 76 (furthest right) is now the Root Node)**

**Final after Step 3:   90 and 76 have been swapped**
