====== Building Heaps ======
Created Monday 28 September 2020

To build a heap from an array, begin with the 0 index digit as the root node, then add the 1 index to the left of the root node.

From there, you may recursively swap out nodes based on the criteria of your heap.

**In a max heap, if a lower Node is greater than a higher Node, you just swap out the greater Node for the lesser Node**

**Example Prior to Swapping:  45 is greater than 4, so we will need to swap 45 and 4**

**Example after swapping:  45 and 4 are swapped**

**Final Max Heap after swapping out smaller Nodes:  NOTICE THE ROOT IS NO LONGER 90**
