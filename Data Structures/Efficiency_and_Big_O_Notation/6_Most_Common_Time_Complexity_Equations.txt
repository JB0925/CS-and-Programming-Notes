====== 6 Most Common Time Complexity Equations ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

**O(1)**
**O(n)**
**O(log n)**
**O(n log n)**
**O(n ** 2)**
**O(2 ** n)**

Best Time Complexity Score = **O(1)**....computer can complete the task in one step
Next Fastest Time Complexity Score = **O(log n)....**still fast and get more efficient as the size of the data set increases
	-**Binary Search **or **Bisection Search **algorithm is an example of **O(log n) **efficiency
	
Third Fastest Time Complexity Score = **O(n)  **(the last of the "decent" equations)

Fourth Fastest Time Complexity Score = **O(n log n)   **(first relatively bad efficiency score)

Fifth Fastest = **O(n ** 2),   **Sixth Fastest = **O(2 ** n)**....both are very bad in terms of efficiency and are exponential in structure...larger the data set, the more inefficient they become

There is a such thing as **O(n!)**.....very, very, very inefficient
