====== Uses for Linked Lists ======
Created Sunday 20 September 2020

Linked Lists can be used in the backing of other data structures
	- we can use Linked Lists to make Stacks, Queues, etc.
	
**Look at article in comments of [[YouTube]] video. See below:**

Examples of Linked Lists:
	1). **A playlist**....Node contains all the data, and a pointer to the next song in the playlist
	2). **A photoviewer**....Node contains the image(data)....and a pointer to the next image in the viewer
