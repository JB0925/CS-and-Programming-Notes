====== The Dictionary ======
Created Wednesday 23 September 2020

**Dictionaries:**
	- Dictionaries are one of the most abstract Data Structures
	- Dictionaries are also sometimes called maps and associative arrays 
	- Dictionary stores information in KEY/VALUE pairs

Think of a KEY/VALUE pair like a social security number….
Dictionaries don’t have a numerical index….they use a key as their index.

Keys can be anything you can think of

**Two extremely important limitations of dictionaries:**
	- Every key can only appear once in the dictionary
	- Each key can only have one value

**There can be duplicate values in a dictionary (two separate, different keys, with the same value)**
