====== Efficiency and Big O Notation ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

**Big O Notation:**
	- a way to basically "Score" a data structure based on four criteria:
		- accessing elements
		- inserting an element
		- deleting an element
		- searching for an element
	
	-can create a "report card" for each data structure based on how efficiently it can do each of the above things
	-used to tell what it is good at, and what it is bad at
	
**Big O Notation Time-Complexity Equation:**
	-works by inserting the size of the data-set as an integer n, and returning the number of operations that need to be conducted by the computer before the function can finish
	
	**N = size of the data structure (# of elements in it)**
	
	-always use the worst case scenario, to be prepared for what could happen
	**O(n), O(n**2), etc. = **the equation that will determine how many steps the computer has to run to perform the operation with that data structure
	
	**O(2) = **2 operations the computer has to run....also knows as constant time
	
	
**Efficiency** is not the end all / be all for deciding on which data structure to use.
**Some **have specific features or quarks that separate them
