====== Create an Array ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

**How to create an array:**
	- populate the array with elements right then and there
	- set a specific size for the array, then populate it later

**Populate-First Arrays:**
	- defining and filling an array as soon as you create it is used mainly for when you already
	  know which values are going to be held within it
	**Java = **int array[ ] = {1,2,3};
	**Python = **array = [1,2,3]
	**C# = **int[ ]array = {1,2,3};
	

**Populate-Later Arrays:**
	- creating an array by setting an initial size for our array, but not filling it with any elements
		- slowly populate it as the programs run
		- used for **user-entered** information
		**Java = **int array [ ] = new int[10];
		**C# = int[ ] array = new int[10];**
