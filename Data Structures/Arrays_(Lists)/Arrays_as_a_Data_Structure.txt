====== Arrays as a Data Structure ======
Created Wednesday 16 September 2020

**Four Big O() Scoring Categories:  **1). Accessing, 2). Searching, 3). Inserting, 4). Deleting

**Accessing an Array = O(1) .....**1 step, constant time
**Searching an Array = O(n) **.....n = however many elements are in the array
**Inserting into an Array = O(n)**
**Deleting from an Array = O(n)**

**Pros and Cons:**

**Pros:**
	- good for storing similar contiguous data
	- O(1) accessing power
	- Very basic and easy to learn
	
**Cons:**
	- Size of the array cannot be changed once initialized
	- Inserting and Deleting are not efficient
	- Can be wasting storage space
