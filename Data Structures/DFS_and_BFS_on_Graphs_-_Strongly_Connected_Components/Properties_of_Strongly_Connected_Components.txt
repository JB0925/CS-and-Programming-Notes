1). If there is more than one MSCC in a graph, they can ONLY be MSSCs if there is no overlap, meaning that no other node is present in the other subset.

2). An **MSCC Supergraph** is when someone draws edges between each instance of an MSCC.
	- The **MSCC Supergraph** MUST be a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**
	- if there IS a cycle, then the entire graph becomes one big MSCC

3). The reverse graph (edges pointing the other way) has the same MSCCs as the original.
