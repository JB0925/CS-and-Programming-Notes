====== DFS Algorithm to Find and Print MSCCs ======
Created Monday 16 May 2022

1). Do a DFS on the entire graph.
	- get the **start time **and **finish time** of every node
		- review **DFS and BFS on Graphs: DFS and BFS - Discovery and Finish Times **for more
		- keep a running list of the nodes in **descending order of finish times (highest finish time first)**
2). Do a DFS on the reversed graph (the graph transposed).
	- do this by iterating through the adjacency list and reversing the edges
	- do the DFS **in the descending order of finish times**
