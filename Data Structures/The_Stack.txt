====== The Stack ======
Created Wednesday 16 September 2020

**Random Access Data Structures: **Arrays, arrayLists, etc.   ....elements can always be accessed directly and in **O(1) **or **constant** time

**Sequential Access Data Structures: **Stacks, Queues, etc.
	- elements can only be accessed in a particular order
	- each element is dependent upon the others
	- may only be obtainable through those other elements
	
Think of sequential access data structures like a tape measure....in order to get to 72in, you first have to go past 1, 2, 3, etc.

**RADS												SADS**
1). O(1) accessing 										Do not provide O(1) accessing
2). Independent elements that can be simply accessed			Dependent elemens
	 by index.
3). Arrays and Array Lists									Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, etc.


**The Stack:**
	- a sequential access data structure where we add and remove elements according to the LIFO (**Last In First Out) **Principle
	- like a stack of books (if you want a book in the middle of the stack, you first have to take off the books on top of it i.e. **LIFO**)
