====== Common Stack Methods ======
Created Wednesday 16 September 2020

**Stack Methods:**
	1). Push method
	2). Pop method
	3). Peek method
	4). Contains method

**Push Method:			Push(object), returns None**
	- pushes an object onto the **top** of the stack
	- by pushing, the latest pushed object becomes the top of the stack, and its size increases by one
	- **stack.push('now')       stack = ['now']**
	- **stack.push('channel')  stack = ['now', 'channel']**
	-** stack.push('this')        stack = ['now', 'channel', 'this']......** and so on
	
**Pop Method:			Pop(), returns the object back to the user**
	- takes no arguments
	- first object on the stack gets popped off and returned to the programmer, second element is now the top of the stack
	
**Peek Method:			Peek(), returns the contents of the top element**
	- allows you to get the value at the top of the list without removing it
	- if I ran it on the above example:
		**stack.peek() = 'this'**

**Contains Method:		Contains(object), returns a boolean of whether or not that object is in the stack**
	- used for searching through the stack
