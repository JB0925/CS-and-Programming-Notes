====== The Queue ======
Created Wednesday 16 September 2020

**The Queue:**
	- A sequential access data structure that follows the **FIFO** method, or First In First Out
	- Stacks and Queues are similar
	- think of a cafeteria line....first kid in line is always the first one out
	- first element added will be the first to be removed
	- **stack = add AND remove elements from the top or head**
	- **queue = add elements to the back, remove elements from the front/top or head**
	
**Queue Methods:**
	1). Enqueue Method
	2). Dequeue Method
	3). Peek Method
	4). Contains Method
	
**Enqueue Method: 			Enqueue(object)**
	- adds elements to the tail of the queue
	- add another element, and the first item in becomes the head of the queue, while the one just added becomes the tail
	
**Dequeue Method:			Dequeue(), returns the removed element back to the user/programmer**
	- removes elements from the head of the queue

**Peek Method:				Peek(), returns the first object WITHOUT removing it**
	- let's you look at the top element of the queue without removing it

**Contains Method:			Contains(object), returns boolean**
	- returns whether or not the queue contains the given object
