**Strongly Connected Components **are subsets of a graph in which there is a path to any node in the subset from any other node in the subset.

**Maximal Strongly Connected Components **are SCCs in which no other nodes can be added to the subset while still retaining the property where any node is reachable from any other node within the subset.

**Examples:**
	- the subset 0 → 2 → 1 is a **MSSC**, because no other nodes can be added that can reach every other node in the subset
		- for example, if you tried to add 3, any of the nodes in [0, 2, 1] can all reach 3, but there is **no path** from 3 to any other node in the subset [0, 2, 1]
		
	- both [3] and [4] are called **trivial MSSCs**, because they are only composed of themselves.
		- why isn't 3 → 4 considered an **SSC**? Because while there is a path from 3 to 4, there is no path from 4 to 3.
