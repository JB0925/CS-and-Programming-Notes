====== Heaps ======
Created Saturday 26 September 2020

**Heaps – Introduction:**
	- Think back to Binary Search Tree:
		- Each Node can have no more than 2 Children Max
		- Child to the left has a value <= the Parent Node
		- Child to the right has a value >= the Parent Node
		 - No two Nodes can contain the same value

**A Heap:**
	- A Heap is a special Tree where all Parent Nodes **compare** to their Child Nodes in some way by being **more** or **less** extreme
	- They will be either **greater than** or **less than** their Child Nodes
	- Whether the Parent is greater or less than its Child Nodes **determines where the data is stored**
	- It is usually dependent on the Parent Node’s value


**Min-Heaps:**
	 - A **Min-Heap** is a Tree where the value of the **Root Node** is less than every one of its Child Nodes
	- This **must be true recursively** for all other Parent Nodes in the Tree (they must all always be less than their children).

**Max-Heaps:**
	- Exact opposite of Min-Heaps. Value at the root must be **greater** than the values of each of its Child Nodes
	- Same **must be true recursively throughout the Tree. Example below:**

**Heaps are extremely easy to insert or remove from, given the way they are structured (min or max heap)**
