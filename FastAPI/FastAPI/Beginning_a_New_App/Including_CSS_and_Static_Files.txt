====== Including CSS and Static Files ======
Created Saturday 03 April 2021

Create a directory at root level (inside of dir with **init** file) called **static**.

In that directory create a **myfile.css **(call it whatever)

In the head of the main html file, create a link for the css stylesheet
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	**NOTE:** In the red is how you link the css stylesheet. **This goes in "base.pt"**
	**NOTE2: **You will have to **poetry add aiofiles** for the above and below to work.

Over in the **main.py** file, in the **configure_routes()** function, add the below:
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
	
	**NOTE:** 'StaticFiles is from **starlette**, which Fastapi is based on. To import this, at the top of the file, add:
	
	{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
