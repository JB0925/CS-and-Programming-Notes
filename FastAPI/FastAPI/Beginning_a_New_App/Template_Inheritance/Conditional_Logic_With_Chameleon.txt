====== Conditional Logic With Chameleon ======
Created Sunday 04 April 2021

If you want your HTML to render differently based on some condition, you can use **tal:condition='your condition here" **as an attribute in the HTML tag.

To make it so that Chameleon knows what "**your condition here**" is, in the Base Viewmodel class, set a class attribute. So if your condition is **"is_logged_in**", in the Base Viewmodel class, set **self.is_logged_in = False**.

**Example:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}}
	
	NOTE the '**tal:condition in the div attributes for both sides of the if/else combo**
