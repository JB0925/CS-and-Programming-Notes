====== Global Init, Create Session, and Initial Setup ======
Created Wednesday 07 April 2021

1). **Create a model_base file, i.e. modelbase.py:**
	{{.\pasted_image.png}} #this is the base that all SQLAlchemy classes will inherit from


2). **Create an _all_models.py file:**
	{{.\pasted_image001.png}}  #this is the whole file


3). **Create a db_session.py file:**
	**Imports:**
		{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
		#Session - used to create a Session every time the app runs
		#config - used to get the connection string from the .env file
		#SqlAlchemyBase - used to create the tables and engine, and start the models upon the app running
		
	**global_init():**
		**NOTE:** If you are using sqlite3, you'd need a directory to put the file that is created in
		{{.\pasted_image003.png}}
		#create the engine, let the Base class see all models and create the tables
	
	**create_session():**
		{{.\pasted_image004.png}}
		# create a new session each time the app begins
