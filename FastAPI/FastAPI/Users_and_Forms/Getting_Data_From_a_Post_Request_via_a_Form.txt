====== Getting Data From a Post Request via a Form ======
Created Sunday 04 April 2021

**Example form:**
{{.\pasted_image.png}}

**Get data from the Form on a POST request:**
	- to get data from a POST request, you have to create a new view. You can call it the same name.
	**Example:**
		{{.\pasted_image001.png}}
		
		**NOTES:**
			- note the use of the different **router** methods(GET and POST)
			- ignore the difference in view models (typo was fixed)
			- to use **post **to get data from forms, you'll need to use **async** and **await**, both in the view and in the viewmodel:
				**Example:**
					{{.\pasted_image002.png}}
					
					- notice how the **load()** function is **async** and the form is **await**
					- in the top example, **vm.load()** is the **load() **function directly above.
