====== Bags, Stacks, and Queues ======
Created Sunday 27 December 2020

**Two ways of implementing a Stack:**
	1). Linked List (push/add, pop, is_empty())
	2). array (or Python list)
	

**Drawback to using arrays (not Python lists):**
	the biggest drawback is that, in most languages, the array size has to be declared ahead of time.
	This is not so in Python, but in most other languages you do.
	
**Things to Consider when Creating a Stack:**
	1). Throw an exception if you pop from an empty stack
	2). Overflow (i.e., the amount of objects on the stack is greater than the size of the stack.) Create a resizing array to use in that situation.
	

**Resizing Array:**
	with a resizing array, if your main array is full, you create a "resizing array", which is just like your other array, except twice as big.
	you copy over the data from the other array to the new array.
	
	Code:

	**Step 1). **
		create a new class called **ResizingArrayStack**, or something similar
		
	**Step 2).**
		create a **push** method, that takes the string and an item
		
		__if N == len(string):__
			__resize(2 * len(s))__
			s[N++] = item
