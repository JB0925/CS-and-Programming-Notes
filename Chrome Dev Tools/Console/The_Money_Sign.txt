$_ will give you the last value you computed in the console.

$0 will give you the last thing you computed, $1 will give you the next to last thing you computed, etc.

**This can be useful by selecting an item, typing "$0" in the console, and pressing enter. This will isolate the element in the console and allow you to inspect it in isolation from the other elements.**

The circle with a line through it (like Ghost Busters) will clear the console.
