The **network** tab tells you what files are being loaded, the status, how long they take to load, their size, etc.

You can click on any of the tabs at the top such as JS, CSS, etc. to see only those specific types of files.

You can inspect AJAX calls to see the results, headers, what was sent, etc. by clicking on the **XHR** tab.
