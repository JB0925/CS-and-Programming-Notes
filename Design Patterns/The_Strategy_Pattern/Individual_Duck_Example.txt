====== Individual Duck Example ======
Created Thursday 17 February 2022

**NOTE: **Because these ducks will extend the duck class, a few things are true:
	1). They will need to instantiate one of the FlyBehavior and QuackBehavior classes.
	
	2). They will need to implement a **display()** method.
	
	3). They all inherit the **swim()** method as is.

public class MallardDuck extends Duck {
	**// instantiating a new MallardDuck **
	**// from within the class instead of **
	**// passing it into another method**
	
	public MallardDuck() {
		**// recall that the Duck class had **
		**// two vars called flyBehavior and**
		**// quackBehavior**
		quackBehavior = new Quack();
		flyBehavior = new FlyWithWings(); 
	}
	
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("I'm a real Mallard duck.");
	}
}
