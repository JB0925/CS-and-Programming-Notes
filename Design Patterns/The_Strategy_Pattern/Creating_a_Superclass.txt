====== Creating a Superclass ======
Created Thursday 17 February 2022

**NOTE:** After creating this class, along with the interfaces and subclasses, we can now begin to create individual instances of different ducks.

public abstract class Duck {
	**// both of the next two lines will be**
	**// of type FlyBehavior and QuackBehavior **
	**// and are instances of one of the classes**
	**// that implements that interface**
	FlyBehavior flyBehavior;
	QuackBehavior quackBehavior;
	
	abstract void display();
	public Duck() { }
	
	**// next two methods are wrappers that**
	**// will call the method from the class**
	**// instantiated above**
	public void performFly() {
		flyBehavior.fly();
	}
	
	public void performQuack() {
		quackBehavior.quack();
	}
	
	public void swim() {
		System.out.println("All ducks float!");
	}
	
}
