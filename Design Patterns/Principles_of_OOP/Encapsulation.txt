====== Encapsulation ======
Created Wednesday 02 February 2022

Encapsulation is the idea of keeping variables and the internal state of a class, hidden from being accessed inside of other methods.

**Example of Non-Encapsulation:**

**public class Main {**
	**public static void main(String[] args) {**
		var account = new Account();
		**account.balance = -1;**
	}
}

What if we weren't supposed to have a class with a negative balance, as we see on the last line above the brackets?

Encapsulation is about disallowing other classes or functions to be able to access or change the internal variables of a class.
