====== Create an Interface ======
Created Tuesday 01 February 2022

In Java, creating an interface is as simple as:

**public interface TaxCalculator {**
	**float calculateTax();**
}


This means that any class that uses the **TaxCalculator **interface MUST have the **calculateTax** method.

**NOTE** that there are no curly braces after the name of the function.
