====== Using a Tax Calculator ======
Created Tuesday 01 February 2022

public class TaxCalculator2019 **implements TaxCalculator {**
	var balance = 2;
	public static void calculateTax() {
		this.balance *= 1.5
	}
}


public class TaxCalculator2020 **implements TaxCalculator {**
	var balance = 15;
	public static void calculateTax() {
		this.balance *= 3.2
	}
}

So here, we make changes to the TaxCalculator2019 class.

We could also have a **TaxCalculator2020** class, but instead of inheriting from **TaxCalculator2019**, and potentially breaking if **TC2019** changes, it just implements the interface, and is independent of **TC2019, **even though they would both have whatever methods are in the **TaxCalculator **interface,
