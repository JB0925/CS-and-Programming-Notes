====== Coupling ======
Created Tuesday 01 February 2022

Coupling occurs when one class depends on another class.

**Example:**

class Main {
	constructor() {
		this.hello = "hello"
	}

	getStuff(name) {
	  **const user = User("Jesse")**
	}
}

In the example, the Main class depends on the User class. 

Well, what if the user class changes? That then breaks the main class.

Well what if something else relies on the User class? You'd have to update that, too. 

What if the User class is dependent upon some other class or function that updates? That would need to change, too. 

This tight coupling makes applications hard to extend. 

**Example of Loose Coupling:**
	- a car: If you change a tire, the other tires don't suddenly HAVE to be changed
	- if the transmission goes bad, the windshield doesn't automatically need to be replaced.
	
**How to Build Loosely Coupled Applications:**
	- use **interfaces**
