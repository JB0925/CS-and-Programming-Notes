====== A Simple Factory Pattern ======
Created Thursday 17 February 2022

{{~/Desktop/ScreenShots/Simple Factory Pattern.png}}

Here we have created a Pizza Factory called SimplePizzaFactory 

It has a method, whose return type is Pizza, called createPizza. It accepts a type of pizza that is a String.

It has conditional logic to choose which pizza class to instantiate and return.


**How do we use it?**

public Pizza orderPizza(String type) {
	**// an instance of SimplePizzaFactory**
	Pizza pizza = factory.createPizza(type);
	
	pizza.prepare();
	pizza.cook();
	return pizza;
}
