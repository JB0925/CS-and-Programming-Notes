====== Diagraming The Factory Method ======
Created Thursday 17 February 2022

First, we will now make the PizzaStore an abstract class, that any other Franchises will extend. It will have two methods:
	**PizzaStore **
		createPizza();  **// will be abstract**
		orderPizza();
	
	This code can be shared by any store.
	

Next, we will have classes to subclass the PizzaStore. They will both have the createPizza() method used in the PizzaStore.
	**ChicagoStylePizzaStore**
		createPizza();
	
	**NYStylePizzaStore**
		createPizza();
	
	
	**NOTE:** Because **createPizza** is abstract, each pizza store can implement their own createPizza method, which lets them choose what types of pizzas to make.
