Created Friday 18 February 2022

public abstract class PizzaStore {
	abstract Pizza createPizza(String item);
	
	public Pizza orderPizza(String type) {
		**// the "createPizza(type); method**
		**// comes from our simple factory**
		Pizza pizza = createPizza(type);
		System.out.println("Making a " + pizza.getName());
		
		pizza.prepare();
		pizza.bake();
		pizza.cut();
		pizza.box();
	}
}


**NOTE:** Remember, **each store** will have to implement the **createPizza** method, and each can create its own method based on its needs.
