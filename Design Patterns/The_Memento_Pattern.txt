====== The Memento Pattern ======
Created Friday 22 April 2022


**1). The Editor**
	- takes in the text
	- has two methods:
		- createState();
			- job is to create an [[EditorState]] object, which essentially freezes, or "memoizes" the state of the Editor object at that point in time. 
		- restore(state);
			- job is to restore the state of the Editor object by calling on an [[EditorState]] object from a previous time.

**2), The [[EditorState]] **
	- the [[EditorState]] is essentially a snapshot of the Editor object at a particular moment in time. It saves whatever is in the Editor when **createState();** is called.
	- it works together with the History object, which is essentially a list of [[EditorState]] objects
	

**3). The History**
	- The History object is a list of [[EditorStates]] and, when restore(state); is called, we are calling to the History object to grab a previous [[EditorState]] object, which will then become the current Editor.
	


**Pattern:**
	- Editor: The "worker", where the text gets edited
	- EditorState: The saved state, the object that can become the current Editor again. Creating a "memo".
	- History: A record of saved states. Can be called on to retrieve a previous version of the Editor.
