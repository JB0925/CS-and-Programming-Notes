====== Async and Await ======
Created Friday 09 April 2021

Async and await make apps much more scalable.

When you use async and await, you are running code, but also doing other things while you are waiting for that code to return.

**A Basic Async Method:**

**NOTE: in order to use this method, you have to add "httpx" to your requirements**



Async and await are built on the ASGI server, as a WSGI server is not capable of working with async and await.
