====== Lint JS by Configuring and Running ESLint ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

To install eslint:
	**npm install --save-dev eslint**
	
Following that, you can run:
	**npx eslint .**

Once this is complete, if you type **commandButton + .** over the eslint error, it will give you options as to how to fix the error.

**NOTE:** You can also, in your terminal, run **npx eslint . --fix **to do the same thing.
