====== eslint-config-prettier ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

Run the command below to install and help avoid situations where **eslint** and **prettier** might clash:
	**npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier**


Next, in the **.eslintrc** file, in the **"extends"** key that we added, after **"eslint:recommended"**, add in **"eslint-config-prettier"**

Now, any clashes that there might've been with eslint and prettier should be resolved.
