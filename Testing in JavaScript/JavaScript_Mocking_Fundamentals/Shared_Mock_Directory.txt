====== Shared Mock Directory ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

Instead of passing in:
	**jest.mock("axios", () => {**
		return {
			getWinner: jest.fn((p1, p2) => p1)
		}
	**});**
	
	
You can create a module **outside** of your test directory. Jest will automatically pick up this directory.
	`**__mocks__**
	
In that directory, create files that have the **name of the module you are trying to mock.**

In this case, we are mocking **utils.js**, so our file would be in **`__mocks__/utils.js**

In that file, you can simply mock out the methods you want:
	**module.exports = {**
		getWinner: jest.fn((p1, p2) => p1)
	}
	

Finally, in your test file, you can just call **jest.mock("myModule");**
