====== Monkey Patching ======
Created Sunday 09 January 2022

Monkey patching deals with taking a known function that may be playing a part in a higher order function, and making that function always return the way you want it to for testing purposes.

**Example:**

const assert = require("assert");
const thumbWar = require("../thumb-war");
const utils = require("../utils");

**const originalGetWinner = utils.getWinner**
**utils.getWinner = (p1, p2) => p1;**

const winner = thumbWar("me", "you");
assert.strictEqual(winner, "me");

**utils.getWinner - originalGetWinner;**


Our original **getWinner** function is mocked to always return **p1**, because the original function always returns a winner randomly.

At the end, we clean up by resetting **getWinner** back to **originalGetWinner**, meaning the original function.
